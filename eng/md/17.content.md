## Esther - Introduction (id: 718561)

Introduction to Esther
======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of Esther

1. King Ahasuerus sends away his wife, the queen (1:1–22\)
2. Ahasuerus chooses Esther as the new queen (2:1–23\)
3. Haman plots to destroy the Jews (3:1–15\)
4. Mordecai asks Esther to help her people (4:1–17\)
5. Esther pleads with the king for the Jews (5:1–7:10\)
6. The result of Haman’s plot to destroy the Jews (8:1–9:16\)
7. The Feast of Purim (9:17–32\)
8. Conclusion (10:1–3\)

### What is the Book of Esther about?

The Book of Esther tells how a young Jewish woman named Esther became the queen of Persia. As queen, she worked to save all the Jews in the Persian Empire from being destroyed.

This book ends by telling why the Jews celebrate the festival of Purim. The name “Purim” comes from the word “pur,” which means “lots” or “dice.” Haman, the enemy of Jews, threw dice to choose when to attack and destroy the Jews. The Jews celebrate Purim to remember how Yahweh rescued his people from being destroyed.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators can use the traditional title of this book, which is “The Book of Esther” or just “Esther.” Or they can choose a clearer title, such as “The Book About Esther.”

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### What was the Persian Empire?

King Cyrus the Great conquered and ruled over many kingdoms. This was in the part of the world called Persia, which is now Iran. So people named his kingdom the Persian Empire. When Cyrus conquered Babylonia in 539 B.C., he then controlled the Jews whom the Babylonians had earlier taken into exile.

### Why were there Jews in Babylonia when the Persians conquered it?

In 586 B.C., the Babylonians conquered and took into exile the people of Judah. These Jews and their descendants were still in Babylon when the Persians conquered it.

### What was meant by “the laws of the Medes and Persians”?

The phrase “the laws of the Medes and Persians” is found in Esther 1:19 and Daniel 6:12\. It referred to laws and decrees that could not be changed or removed once they were issued. In the book of Esther, the king made a decree that the people could attack the Jews. Later he regretted that decision but he was not able to change the decree.

The term “Medes” refers to a people group that had formed its own nation, but the Persians conquered them.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### What different levels of language are in the Book of Esther?

In the Book of Esther, people talk to each other in many different situations. There is the polite and stately talk in the Persian court and the words of royal decrees. Friends and close relatives also talk to each other. There are even the words that one uses in speaking to oneself. Translators should use all the ways their own language has to express these different situations in a way that their readers will identify and understand.

### The king’s divorce

The king’s advisers were afraid that husbands would lose their authority when they heard the queen had refused to come to show her beauty to the king’s guests, so the advisers told him to divorce her.

## Esther 1:1 (#1) (id: 261875)

**"Now it happened"**

In the Old Testament, this is a standard way of beginning a historical story. Many languages have similar story\-opening formulas, and if your language has one, you can use it. But do not use it if it would suggest that the story is not real, only made up. Alternate translation: “this account happened”

## Esther 1:2 (#4) (id: 261886)

**"the citadel"**

This means a castle or palace where a king would live. But since the city of Susa itself is being called a **citadel** here, it’s likely that the term means royal city or capital city. The person telling this story is identifying Susa as the capital by calling it by the name of something closely associated with it, the royal palace within it. A good translation might be “the capital city of Persia.”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:3

## Esther 1:3 (#6) (id: 261892)

**"before his face"**

**Face** stands for the presence of a person, so this phrase means “in his presence.” The invitation was to come to the royal capital to attend a banquet where the king would be present in person.

## Esther 1:4 (#6) (id: 261898)

**"for many days, 180 days"**

This was a very long time for a royal feast to last. The earlier part of the verse provides the reason for this. To make the connection explicit, you could add some explanatory words to the verse like this: “Ahasuerus entertained his guests fabulously because he wanted to demonstrate that his empire was extremely wealthy and that he was a very powerful king. He did so many things for them that the festivities lasted for six months.”

* **Associated Articles:** Numbers (ID: `33392@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 1:5 (#3) (id: 261902)

**"in Susa the citadel"**

The expression in this case seems to refer specifically to the royal **citadel** from which the city got its name. This second feast would not have been for everyone in the entire city. It was specifically for the people who served the king in the citadel and who had worked so hard over the previous six months hosting the first feast. Alternate translation: “for every man who worked for him in the palace at Susa”

Alternate translation: “there was to be no restriction on drinking” (2\) There would be no requirement to drink. Alternate translation: “no one must be forced to drink” Either way, this was another sign of the generosity that the king showed as he hosted this banquet to thank the people who worked for him. Either he was: (1\) allowing them to drink as much as they wanted to, or (2\) not requiring them to eat and drink everything that was served at a banquet as guests of the king would usually be expected to do. You could say explicitly at the beginning of the verse that the king was giving his guests a special privilege.

**"for thus the king had established for every overseer of his house to do according to the desire of man by man"**

This explains why no one had to drink if they did not want to. If it would be helpful in your language, you could give this explanation (the reason) before the result that it accounts for, using a connecting word like “so.” You could say, “The king had established for every overseer of his house to do according to the desire of man by man, so the drinking was according to the law, ‘There is no compulsion.’” Alternate translation: “the king made the attendants who served the wine follow this rule”

This term occurs a dozen times in the story. It describes male royal officials who served as guardians for the women who lived in the palace. They were both guardians of the door, to keep unwanted people out of the women’s quarters, and guardians of the women inside, to take care of them and look after their needs. (As we learn in 2:21, some of these officials also protected the king’s private quarters.) As we see here, and as will also be seen in 2:14 and 2:16, their duties included escorting women from place to place. The term likely indicates that, in keeping with the practices of the time, these men were castrated because their work brought them into such close contact with the king’s wives and concubines. If your language has a term for such an official and you think your readers would recognize it, you could use it. Otherwise, you could use a term that describes the role that these officials played in the royal court. Alternate translation: “guardians” or “officials” or “castrated servants”

## Esther 1:11 (#5) (id: 261941)

**"in order to show the people and the officials her beauty"**

Everything Ahasuerus did at his banquets was to show how rich and powerful he was. He seems to have believed that having a very beautiful wife was one more thing that proved he was a great man. So he wanted everyone to see how beautiful Vashti was. You can put this second in the verse, after explaining that Vashti was a very beautiful woman, because it accounts for what happens afterwards, when the king sends his seven personal servants to bring her in to his banquet.

## Esther - Chapter 2 Introduction (id: 718563)

Esther 2 General Notes
======================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Esther becomes queen

Esther was humble and took the advice of the royal officials about how to dress for her time with the king. The king chose Esther to be the new queen.

### Mordecai warns the king against a plot

Esther’s cousin, Mordecai, discovered that two men planned to kill the king. He told Esther, who then told the king. She also gave Mordecai credit for telling her.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 2:1

## Esther 2:1 (#1) (id: 262015)

**"After these things"**

This introduces a new event that happened some time later, but we do not know how much later. You can show this with a phrase like “After some time had passed.”

See: Introduction of a New Event

## Esther 2:1 (#2) (id: 262016)

* **Associated Passages:** EST 2:1

## Esther 2:1 (#3) (id: 262017)

**"he remembered Vashti"**

This means that he started to think about Vashti. He probably thought about the things that he liked about her, meaning that he missed her.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 2:1

## Esther 2:1 (#4) (id: 262018)

**"what she had done, and what had been decided concerning her"**

This refers to Vashti’s refusal to obey Ahasuerus, and to the decision he made in [1:21](https://ref.ly/Esth1:21) that she could never come into his presence again. This could actually mean that when he thought about Vashti and what she had done, he regretted the decision that he had made about her. But there was nothing he could do to bring her back because the laws of the empire could not be changed. You could explain all or some of this in your translation, as in the UST.

This is something that the story’s original audience would have understood implicitly. you could say it explicitly if your readers need this information to understand the story: “Each young woman in the harem, one at a time, was going to have sexual relations with King Ahasuerus and become one of his concubines” or “one of his secondary wives.”

The information is given twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that Ahasuerus was completely convinced that Esther was the one he should make his queen\*\*.\*\* “More than all the virgins” basically duplicates the meaning of “more than all the women,” so, if this duplication would be confusing in your language, you don’t need to include both phrases, or you could say, “more than all of them” for the second phrase.

## Esther 2:17 (#3) (id: 262141)

**"and she lifted favor and kindness before his face"**

This is a rare expression in Hebrew, and the exact meaning is uncertain. See how you translated similar phrases in [2:9](https://ref.ly/Esth2:9) and [2:15](https://ref.ly/Esth2:15). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. In this context, it probably means that King Ahasuerus was very impressed with both Esther’s appearance and her personality.

Esther 3 General Notes
======================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Haman plots against the Jews

Mordecai was told to prostrate himself before Haman. This would be considered to be worship. But for a Jew, it was wrong to worship someone other than Yahweh. Because of this, he refused to do it. This made Haman angry, so he decided to kill all the Jews in the Persian Empire. Haman was a descendant of Agag, a king of the Amalekite people. The Amalekites became the enemies of the Jews during the exodus (Exodus 17:8–16\). Moses told the people that they would need to destroy them (Deuteronomy 25:17–19\), and later God commanded Saul to destroy them (1 Samuel 15:2–3\). Samuel killed King Agag (1 Samuel 15:33\), but the Amalekites were never completely destroyed (1 Samuel 30:17\). Both Mordecai and Haman were probably very aware that their people were enemies.

## Esther 3:1 (#9) (id: 262184)

**"And all the servants of the king who were at the gate of the king"**

Here, the **gate of the king**, probably the entrance to the citadel, may represent the citadel itself, the place where these people served the king. The citadel, in turn, would represent everyone who served the king. So you could say just “all the king’s other servants.” However, this may also be a reference to the specific group of officials who were stationed at the gate, the way Mordecai was.

## Esther 3:2 (#6) (id: 262191)

## Esther 3:2 (#8) (id: 262193)

**"But Mordecai would neither bow down nor would he prostrate himself"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was against the king’s command and how much determination it took for Mordecai to remain standing. You could combine these phrases as UST does and say, “But Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not bow down or lie on the ground”

## Esther 3:2 (#9) (id: 262194)

**"But Mordecai would neither bow down nor would he prostrate himself"**

It appears that as a Jew, Mordecai considered it wrong to worship anyone other than Yahweh, and that he believed he would be worshiping Haman if he bowed down low to the ground to honor him. So, on religious grounds, Mordecai refused to bow down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly.

**"And"** \- **"said to Mordecai"**

They spoke to Mordecai because they saw that he did not bow down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. You could say, for example, “The other officials saw that, and they asked Mordecai.”

## Esther 3:4 (#3) (id: 262200)

**"And it happened that, when they spoke to him"** \- **"he did not listen to them"**

Here, **he did not listen** means he did not heed their warning or he did not do what they said. Mordecai heard them, but he did not do what they advised him to do. This means that even though the other officials questioned him and probably warned him, he still refused to bow down.

As in [2:16](https://ref.ly/Esth2:16), you could convert the Hebrew month into an approximate time on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate.

**"the lot"**

A **lot** was an object with different markings on various sides that was used, most likely by dropping it on the ground, to select a specific time for doing something. The belief was that God or the gods would control which way the object fell, thus guiding the selection process and granting favor to the action if it were done on the date chosen.

**"I will weigh out"** \- **"into the hands of the doers of the work"**

This could mean either of two possibilities: (1\) Haman could mean that the king’s men will be able to collect a huge amount of money from the plunder that they would get from the Jews. Referring to the weight would be a way of saying, “I guarantee that it will be at least that much.” This reasoning agrees with 3:13, where the king’s letter specifies that those who kill the Jews can take their plunder. Alternate translation: “we will get so much plunder that the officers you send will be able to bring back” (Also see UST) (2\) “**Weigh out into the hands**” could be an idiom that means Haman himself will pay the officers who will put the plan into effect. Haman will not do this personally, but it means that he will take responsibility for paying them from his own resources. Alternate translation: “From my own resources I will pay … to the men who do the work”

**"and"** \- **"10,000 talents of silver"**

This would be worth over $300 million at current prices today. But since prices vary over time, if you expressed the value in modern measurements, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. Instead you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the talent, and explain in a note that a talent was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does in metric tons.

This would be saying that Haman’s letter had the same authority as it would have had if the king had sent it himself.

**"to all of the provinces of the king"**

Haman did not send the letters to the provinces (the geographical territories) themselves. Rather, he sent them to the officials in every province in the empire. The story is using the word “province” to refer to these officials by something associated with them, the territories they ruled. Your translation should make clear that the letters were sent to people, not places.

Esther 4 General Notes
======================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Mordecai warns Esther to act

Mordecai tells Esther she must beg the king for the Jews’ lives even if she risks her own death.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Implicit information

There is implicit information that translators may not understand. The sentence, “Who knows whether you have come to this royal position for such a time as this?” means “maybe God made you the queen so you could save the Jews.” (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

**"And he went out into the midst of the city"**

The next verse shows that Mordecai was heading towards the king’s palace. You could say that explicitly here. Mordecai might have wanted to call attention to the danger that the Jews were in by going to a public location where people were used to seeing him. Or he might have wanted to contact Esther and ask her to help with the trouble. Or he might have wanted both.

**All the servants of the king** refers to the royal officials in the palace. **The people of the provinces** refers to those living out in the empire.

## Esther 5:1 (#2) (id: 262370)

**"that Esther put on royalty"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **royalty**, you can express the same idea with an adjective and a concrete noun. Alternate translation: “Esther put on the robes that showed that she was the queen”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 5:1 (#3) (id: 262371)

**"that Esther put on royalty"**

It is clear from the story that before she went to see the king, Esther got a banquet ready so that she could invite him and Haman to come to it right away. If it is confusing to leave that out, you can explain that here. Alternate translation, add: “Esther prepared a grand banquet and then put on her royal robes”

## Esther 5:3 (#2) (id: 262387)

**"What is to you, Esther the queen? And what is your request"**

These two phrases mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is very interested in hearing why Esther has come to see him. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if it would be more natural in your language to combine them into one. Alternate translation: “What do you want, Queen Esther?”

## Esther 5:3 (#3) (id: 262388)

**"As much as half of the kingdom, and let it be given to you"**

This was probably a formal and customary expression in the Persian royal court, meant to show honor to the person making a request of the king and to indicate the king’s willingness to be very generous when answering the request. King Ahasuerus was almost certainly not offering to give Esther half of his kingdom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is.” Alternate translation: “I will give you what you want, even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!”

These two question\-and\-statement pairs mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice in slightly different ways to show that he is truly disposed to give Esther whatever she wants. If this is confusing, you do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation. you can combine them into one or replace the repetition with a statement of what the repetition means, as in the UST.

**"What is your petition? And let it be given to you. And what is your request? As much as half of the kingdom, and let it be done"**

When Ahasuerus asked Esther in the throne room what she wanted, she said that she wanted him and Haman to come to a banquet she had prepared. But since the king asks her once again at the banquet what she wants, it is clear that he knew this was not her real request. Instead, he knew that she wanted to show him hospitality first, as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship. You can indicate this by translating, “Now please tell me what you really want.”

**"let the king come with Haman to the banquet that I will make for them"**

If you decide to translate this as “the banquet that I have prepared for you,” then the word “you” should be dual if your language uses that form, since it refers to the king and Haman, otherwise it should be plural.

**"that he neither rose up"**

Under other circumstances, officials were expected to bow low to the ground to show respect for Haman. See [3:2](https://ref.ly/Esth3:2). But since Mordecai was already sitting on the ground as a sign of mourning, he would have been expected to stand up to show respect.

**"But all of this is not equal for me to every time that I see"**

This is a figurative way of speaking. It is as if Haman is weighing his happiness on one side of a scale and his unhappiness on the other side. Haman is saying that his happiness over all the honors he has received is still not greater than his unhappiness over seeing Mordecai fail to honor him, so on balance, he is unhappy.

Haman could be referring to the way Mordecai has been refusing to stand up to honor him, or he could be referring generally to the way Mordecai has never honored him (by either bowing or standing up) ever since he was appointed to a position in the king’s service and stationed at the gate. Either way, being reminded of this dishonor is the reason why Haman continues to be unhappy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly.

**"Who is in the court"**

This could mean either: (1\) The king knows that there is someone in the courtyard, maybe because he heard someone walking there; he wants to know who it is. (2\) Since there are always people around the palace, the king assumes that there must be someone out in the courtyard. In either case, the king wants to know if there is someone there with whom he could consult about the best way to honor Mordecai. As the story has already said in [1:13](https://ref.ly/Esth1:13), it was the king’s habit to consult his advisors on important questions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king wanted to consult someone about the best way to honor Mordecai, so he asked, ‘who is in the courtyard’”

**"They were still speaking with him"**

This phrase indicates something that happened after Haman’s wife and friends started talking with Haman and while they were still talking. You should indicate this with a phrase such as “while.” Alternate translation: “while they were still talking together, the king’s eunuchs arrived”

### Covering Haman’s face

When “the servants covered Haman’s face,” they were showing that he had been condemned to be executed. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:1 (#1) (id: 262528)

**"And the king came with Haman to drink with Esther the queen"**

Esther hosted Ahasuerus and Haman for more than just drinks. This is a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. An entire banquet is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “so the king and Haman went to the second banquet that Queen Esther had prepared”

## Esther 7:2 (#1) (id: 262529)

**"on the second day"**

This refers to the day after the first banquet, as mentioned in [5:8](https://ref.ly/Esth5:8). Alternate translation: “at that second banquet” or “on that second day of feasting”

**"during the banquet of wine"**

Alternate translation: “while they were drinking wine” or “while the servants were pouring the wine and giving it to them”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:2

## Esther 7:2 (#3) (id: 262531)

**"What is your petition,"** \- **"And let it be given to you. And what is your request? As much as half of the kingdom, and let it be done"**

These two statements mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is truly disposed to giving Esther what she wants. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “now please tell me what you really want. Tell me, and I will do it for you”

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:2 (#4) (id: 262532)

**"What is your petition"**

Ahasuerus has now allowed Esther to show her hospitality at two banquets. But he knows that she has done this as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship, and that this signals that she has an important and urgent request to make. You can indicate this by having the king ask, “Now please tell me what you really want.”

## Esther 7:2 (#5) (id: 262533)

**"And let it be given"** \- **"and let it be done"**

You can capture these parallel passive statements with one statement using an active form. Alternate translation: “I will give you what you ask for” or “I will do for you what you ask”

## Esther 7:2 (#6) (id: 262534)

**"is your petition,"** \- **"is your request"**

The two abstract nouns **petition** and **request** can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want”

**"As much as half of the kingdom"**

## Esther 7:3 (#1) (id: 262536)

**"And"** \- **"answered and said"**

Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered”

* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:3 (#2) (id: 262537)

**"If I have found favor in your eyes"**

**Favor** means the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:3 (#3) (id: 262538)

**"If I have found favor in your eyes"**

Here, **eyes** represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:3 (#4) (id: 262539)

**"O king"**

In this case, Esther is addressing Ahasuerus directly as “O king”; she is not speaking about him in the third person as a sign of respect, as she and others usually do elsewhere in the story. This may indicate a special urgency to what she is saying, so it would be good to include this difference in your translation or indicate the urgency in some other way.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:3

## Esther 7:3 (#5) (id: 262540)

**"and if it is good to the king"**

This is an idiom that also appears in [1:19](https://ref.ly/Esth1:19), [3:9](https://ref.ly/Esth3:9), [5:4](https://ref.ly/Esth5:4), and [5:8](https://ref.ly/Esth5:8). The suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good plan to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But here, Esther has just addressed the king directly with “O king” and she is pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people. So an alternate translation here could be something more like, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:3 (#6) (id: 262541)

**"let my life be given to me at my petition and my people at my request"**

The phrases **at my petition** and **at my request** mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the urgency of the request. If it would be more natural in your language, you could combine the two requests. Alternate translation: “please spare my life and save my people” or “my request is that you spare my life and the lives of my people”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:3 (#8) (id: 262543)

## Esther 7:3 (#10) (id: 262545)

**"at my request"**

The abstract noun **request** can be expressed with the verb “ask for.” Alternate translation: “rhat is what I am asking for” or “rhat is what I want”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:4 (#1) (id: 262546)

**"For we have been sold"**

As Esther points out later in the verse, the Jews actually have not been exchanged for money. Rather, **sell** is a figurative way of saying “turn over to.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning by saying something like “For someone has turned us over to our enemies.” Alternatively, you could use the same figure, but show that it is a comparison. Alternate translation: “it is as though I and my people are cattle that have been sold to be slaughtered”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:4 (#2) (id: 262547)

**"For we have been sold"**

You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for someone has sold us” or “for someone has put us in danger of our enemies”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:4 (#3) (id: 262548)

**"for annihilation, for slaughter, and for destruction"**

As in [3:13](https://ref.ly/Esth3:13), these words mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction. If using three words would be difficult or confusing in your language, you could use one word for this and indicate that the destruction is extreme. Alternate translation: “and they are going to kill every one of us” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words.)

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:4 (#4) (id: 262549)

**"for annihilation, for slaughter, and for destruction"**

If your language does not use abstract nouns such as these, you can replace them with one or more verbs. Alternate translation: “and they are going to kill every one of us”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:4 (#5) (id: 262550)

**"Now if we had been sold as slaves and female servants"**

Alternate translation: “if the men and even the women had been sold into slavery”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4

## Esther 7:4 (#6) (id: 262551)

**"the distress would not have been equal to a burden of the king"**

Esther is speaking very deferentially and with some exaggeration in order to impress on the king how important this is to her. She is saying that it would have been worth less to her to see her people rescued from slavery than it would have been to see the king spared the trouble of intervening on their behalf. (Haman uses the expression of “not equal” in this same sense in [5:13](https://ref.ly/Esth5:13).) Alternate translation: “that would have been a matter too small to bother you with” or “that would be a small matter to a king like you, but this is very much worse”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: `33281@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:4 (#7) (id: 262552)

**"the king"**

Esther addresses King Ahasuerus in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “you”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:5 (#1) (id: 262553)

**"And"** \- **"spoke and said"**

These two words mean the same thing. Alternate translation: “responded”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:5
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:5 (#2) (id: 262554)

**"Who is he, this man? Where is this man, he"**

These two phrases mean similar things. They both ask about the identity of the man who is trying to destroy the Jews. King Ahasuerus uses the repetition to emphasize how outraged he is. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two phrases. However, from another perspective, both the man’s identity and his location are important to know so that his plot can be stopped. So, for that reason, you could also decide to include both phrases in your translation.

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:5
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:5 (#3) (id: 262555)

**"Who is he, this man? Where is this man, he"**

Alternate translation: “who has done this”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:5

## Esther 7:5 (#4) (id: 262556)

**"Where is this man, he whose heart is full to do thus"**

Here the concept of a **full heart** uses two metaphors at once. “Heart” represents the action of thinking or feeling. Also, saying that the “heart” is “full” is a figurative way of saying that someone is fully intending to do something, usually something that should not be done. Alternate translation: “where is the man who is intending to do such a thing”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:6 (#1) (id: 262557)

**"an adversary, and an enemy"**

These words mean the same thing. Together, they emphasize Haman’s complete hostility towards the Jews. If it is more natural in your language, you can combine them and indicate the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “the one who is our absolute nemesis”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:6
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:6 (#2) (id: 262558)

**"was terrified"**

Alternative translation: “was extremely afraid”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:6

## Esther 7:6 (#3) (id: 262559)

**"was terrified from before the face of"**

Here, **face** means the presence of a person. The phrase means that Haman was now extremely afraid to be in the presence of King Ahasuerus and Queen Esther. Alternate translation: “this made Haman very afraid to be in the presence of the king and the queen”

## Esther 7:7 (#1) (id: 262560)

**"And the king rose up in his rage from the banquet of wine"**

Here, **in his rage** is an idiom meaning to be extremely angry. Alternate translation: “the king was extremely angry and got up”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:7
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:7 (#2) (id: 262561)

**"to the garden of the palace"**

The implication is that Ahasuerus went outside to absorb the shock that a man he had promoted to the highest position in his empire was plotting to destroy his queen and her whole people. Ahasuerus needed to sort out his conflicting loyalties and decide what to do about this. If it would be misunderstood, you could say explicitly why he went outside. Alternate translation: “he went outside to the palace garden to decide what to do.”

## Esther 7:7 (#3) (id: 262562)

**"in order to seek for his life"**

Here, **seeking** means to beg or plead urgently for something. This phrase means that Haman wanted to beg Esther to persuade the king not to order his execution. Alternate translation: “to plead with Queen Esther to spare his life”

## Esther 7:7 (#6) (id: 262565)

**"evil was determined against him by the king"**

Here the abstract noun **evil** means “harm,” not something that is morally wrong as in the previous verse. In this context, it can be expressed with a verb such as “execute.” Alternate translation: “the king was likely to execute him”

## Esther 7:8 (#1) (id: 262566)

**"Now when the king returned"** \- **"Haman was fallen"**

The implication is that when the king returned to the room, he saw what this verse describes next. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the king returned … , he saw that Haman had fallen … ”

## Esther 7:8 (#2) (id: 262567)

**"Haman was fallen on the couch on which Esther was"**

The implication is that Haman was doing this as he pleaded for his life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could add that information to the end of this phrase: “ … as he was begging Esther to spare his life”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:8

## Esther 7:8 (#4) (id: 262569)

**"Haman was fallen on the couch on which Esther was"**

The expression **was fallen** means that as Haman was begging for his life, he was not standing up; he had suddenly come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a couch. (From the impression that the king got when he returned, it is possible that Haman was even grabbing her arms or shoulders as he pleaded with Esther.) Alternate translation: “Haman had come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a banqueting couch” or “Haman had thrown himself down on the couch where Esther was reclining”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:8
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:8 (#5) (id: 262570)

**"the couch on which Esther was"**

In this culture, especially at a banquet like this one, wealthy people would recline on couches as they ate and drank. Alternate translation: “Esther’s banqueting couch”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:8

## Esther 7:8 (#6) (id: 262571)

**"Is it also to subdue the queen with me in the house"**

The king phrases this as a question to show his shock and anger at what he thinks Haman is doing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could phrase it as a statement. Alternate translation: “he is even trying to rape the queen”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** EST 7:8
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 7:8 (#7) (id: 262572)

**"to subdue the queen"**

The story is using a mild expression to refer to something that is disturbing. In this context, “subdue” means “rape.” The king thought that Haman was trying to rape Esther, and he likely said just that. You can show this in your translation if you want to make this clear. Alternate translation: “trying to rape the queen”

* **Associated Articles:** Euphemism (ID: `33268@UWTranslationManual`)

**"with me in the house"**

These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the idea that they are expressing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. However, each one does indicate something slightly different about what a serious offense it would be if Haman actually were trying to rape Esther. It would be a violation of the king’s personal trust and a violation of the trust implicit in hospitality. So you could also include both phrases.

**"The word"** \- **"when they covered the face of Haman"**

The king spoke, and then the servants covered Haman’s face. One action followed upon another. However, this happened so quickly that almost no time seemed to pass in between.

**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say.

## Esther 7:10 (#2) (id: 262590)

**"and the rage of the king subsided"**

Here the story compares the king’s anger to floodwaters, which can cause great destruction. “Subside” means for waters to drain away and for their level to go down. You could express the meaning by saying something like “Then the king’s rage lessened,” or “Then the king was not so angry.” Or you could use a different metaphor that would be meaningful in your language, such as, “Then the king cooled off.”

Esther 8 General Notes
======================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### God’s protection

Yahweh is at work in this chapter preventing the possible destruction of the Jews. God used Esther and Mordecai to protect their people.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:1

## Esther 8:1 (#1) (id: 262591)

**"On that day"**

This could mean one of three things: (1\) A new series of events is now being described, but the story makes clear that they happened on the same day as the second banquet. While it must have been some time later in the day, the idea is that when Haman lost his life, and also his property, Esther gained what her enemy had lost. Alternate translation: “that same day” (2\) The expression could also be an idiom that means “as of that day.” This would refer to the effective date for the transfer of Haman’s property to Esther. Alternate translation: “as of that day” (3\) The term “day” could also be used to mean around the same time.

## Esther 8:1 (#2) (id: 262592)

**"the king Ahasuerus gave to Esther the queen the house of Haman"**

Here, **house** represents all the household and property of Haman. The story could be referring to all the property by naming one part of it, the house. Or “house” could be a metonym for “property,” meaning everything a person owns and keeps in their house, and by extension everything they own beyond the house as well. Alternate translation: “King Ahasuerus declared that everything that Haman had owned would now belong to Queen Esther”

## Esther 8:1 (#4) (id: 262594)

**"And Mordecai came before the face of the king"**

The implication is that when the king learned how Mordecai was related to Esther, he summoned Mordecai into his presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he learned that, the king sent for Mordecai to come into his presence”

* **Associated Articles:** Order of Events (ID: `33269@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:1 (#7) (id: 262597)

**"Esther told what he was to her"**

Esther told this to the king. She would likely have explained not just how she and Mordecai were related, but that he had raised her after her parents died.

**"And the king removed his signet ring,"** \- **"and he gave it to Mordecai"**

Giving the ring to Mordecai showed that Mordecai could now act on the king’s own authority, and it enabled him to do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king now gave this ring to Mordecai to show that Mordecai had the power to act on the authority of the king”

## Esther 8:2 (#5) (id: 262602)

## Esther 8:3 (#1) (id: 262605)

**"And Esther repeated her action, and she spoke before the face of the king"**

## Esther 8:3 (#3) (id: 262607)

**"She fell before the face of his feet"**

Here, **falling** is an idiom referring to the action of bowing down or prostrating oneself, and **face** represents the front of a person, place, or object. Alternate translation: “and she bowed down” or “and she prostrated herself”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:3 (#4) (id: 262608)

**"She fell before the face of his feet"**

This may actually mean that Esther put her face right on top of the feet of King Ahasuerus. This would have been an act of humility and desperation by which she showed that her need was very great and that she believed the king had great power to help her.

See: Symbolic Action

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:3
* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Action (ID: `33402@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:3 (#5) (id: 262609)

**"She fell before the face of his feet"**

Esther’s action was probably a recognized sign of pleading in this culture. However, it would likely still have been remarkable for a queen to fall at the feet of her husband, the king. you could show this by introducing the information with a phrase like “in fact.” Alternate translation: “in fact, to show how desperately she was pleading, Esther got down and put her face right on top of his feet”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:3 (#6) (id: 262610)

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:3 (#7) (id: 262611)

## Esther 8:4 (#1) (id: 262614)

**"And the king held out to Esther the scepter of gold"**

As in [5:2](https://ref.ly/Esth5:2), King Ahasuerus did this to show that Esther had his favor. In that earlier episode, this indicated that he would not enforce the law that said Esther should be executed for coming into the inner court without being summoned. But since Esther was apparently already in the king’s presence on this occasion, it seems that the gesture could also be used generally to show that the king was positively disposed towards a person and would grant the person’s request. Alternate translation: “the king held out his golden scepter to Esther”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:4

## Esther 8:5 (#1) (id: 262618)

**"If it is good to the king,"** \- **"and the word is proper before the face of the king"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying very deferentially that she hopes that the king will think that her suggestion is a good idea and will, therefore, grant her request. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “if what I am going to suggest seems like a good idea to you”

## Esther 8:5 (#2) (id: 262619)

**"and if I have found favor before his face,"** \- **"and I am good in his eyes"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying very deferentially that she hopes that the king is positively disposed towards her, that he thinks well of her, and will, therefore, grant her request. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me”

## Esther 8:5 (#3) (id: 262620)

**"If it is good to the king, and if I have found favor before his face"**

Here Esther addresses the king throughout in the third person as a way of showing respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person, as in the UST.

* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:5 (#4) (id: 262621)

**"If it is good to the king"**

This is an idiom that also appears in [1:19](https://ref.ly/Esth1:19), [3:9](https://ref.ly/Esth3:9), [5:4](https://ref.ly/Esth5:4), and [5:8](https://ref.ly/Esth5:8). A suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But in another place, [7:3](https://ref.ly/Esth7:3), when Esther was pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people, the suggested alternate translation was, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask” Here, Esther is also pleading, so you could use that phrase here in your translation as well. Alternate translation: “if what I ask for seems right in the king’s evaluation”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:5 (#6) (id: 262623)

**"before his face,"** \- **"before the face of the king"**

Here, **face** means the presence of a person. These phrases could mean “as I stand here before you.” But “face” could also be referring to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Esther’s request would become evident in his face first, so it would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “you”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:5 (#7) (id: 262624)

**"let it be written to bring back the letters"**

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:6 (#2) (id: 262628)

**"how could I bear to see the evil that my people would find? And how could I bear seeing the destruction of my kindred"**

Esther is actually making a statement, but she expresses herself in question form to show how strongly she feels about what she is saying. She does not actually expect the king to tell her how she could bear seeing her people destroyed. Alternate translation: “I cannot bear to see disaster fall on the Jews” or “I cannot endure watching my relatives be killed”

## Esther 8:6 (#3) (id: 262629)

**"how could I bear to see the evil that my people would find? And how could I bear seeing the destruction of my kindred"**

These two sentences mean basically the same thing. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “I could not bear to see my relatives and my whole people destroyed”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:6
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:6 (#4) (id: 262630)

**"the evil that my people would find"**

Even though it was morally very wrong for Haman to want to destroy Mordecai’s whole people, here the abstract noun **evil** likely means “harm,” as in [7:7](https://ref.ly/Esth7:7). It means the same thing as “destruction” in the next sentence. Alternate translation: “my people being destroyed”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:6
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Esther 8:6 (#5) (id: 262631)

**"would find"**

As in [1:5](https://ref.ly/Esth1:5), **find** is an idiom that means something exists in a certain place or time, not that people were looking for it and located it. Esther is speaking of the harm that will exist for the Jews if the effect of Haman’s letters is not undone. Alternate translation: “would be destroyed”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EST 8:6
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

**"Behold"**

This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”

## Esther - Chapter 9 Introduction (id: 718570)

Esther 9 General Notes
======================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Purim

The events of this chapter were so significant, the Jews celebrated these events every year after this. It is known as “Purim.”

Important stylistic devices in this chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Ironic Situation

The day that was supposed to bring great victory to the enemies of the Jews became a day of great victory for the Jews. This is a type of irony.

### Opening Summary

Verse 1 of chapter 9 provides a summary of everything that happens in this chapter. If using an opening summary is not normally used in your language, be sure to mark this as a summary either in the text or in a footnote. An opening summary like this is a characteristic device of Hebrew storytelling. So even though it describes the final outcome, we do not recommend that you move it to the end of the chapter unless it is very confusing to leave it here. To make it clear that verse 1 is only a summary and not the entire story, you could say something like this at the end of the verse: “This is what happened” or “Here are more details about what happened.”

**"a Pur (which is “the lot"**

As in 3:7, the storyteller is giving both the Persian and the Hebrew name because this is the story behind the Festival of Purim, which takes its name from “Pur.” So this is not repetition for emphasis. You can put in the Persian name and then the name for “lot” in your own language to show that the storyteller is doing this. Alternate translation: “a Pur (that is, a lot)”

The letter itself did not say this. The story is summarizing the events in compressed form. It is speaking of the letter as if it were a person who could take action and give commands like this, but it was the king who gave the command. Alternate translation: “the king also ordered his servants to hang \[or impale] Haman on a wooden pole \[or hang Haman on a gallows].

## Esther 10:1 (#3) (id: 262918)

**"on the land and the islands of the sea"**

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the greatness of Mordecai. It does that by showing that he was second in command to a very powerful emperor. Referring to both the land and the sea is a way to include everything that lives in a very large area of the earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the general meaning by saying something like “everyone throughout his empire.” Alternate translation: “on all the people in the empire … even the people who lived on the islands in the Mediterranean Sea” or “on everyone throughout the land and even the far\-away islands”

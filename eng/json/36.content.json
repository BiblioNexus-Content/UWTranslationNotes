(This phrase means the same thing as “the declaration of Yahweh,” which occurs several times in the book.) Consider natural ways of identifying direct quotations in your language. It may be more natural for you to put this attribution of the saying to Yahweh at the beginning of the message, that is, at the start of verse 18, as the UST does.</p><p>See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26840\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Quotations and Quote Margins</span></p>",

## 3 John - Introduction (id: 700156)

Introduction to 3 John
======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of the book of 3 John

1. Introduction (1:1\)
2. Encouragement and instructions to show hospitality (1:2–8\)
3. Condemnation of Diotrephes (1:9–10\)
4. Instructions to imitate what is good (1:11\)
5. Praise for Demetrius (1:12\)
6. Conclusion and greetings (1:13–15\)

### Who wrote the book of 3 John?

The letter does not give the name of the author. The author only identified himself as **The elder** (1:1\). The letter was probably written by the apostle John near the end of his life, after he had written the Gospel of John and the letters 1 John and 2 John. In this letter, John referred to himself as “the elder.” This may have been because of his old age, or because he was a leader in the church, or both, since both were true. If possible, in your translation use a word in your language that can refer to both old age and church leadership.

### What is the book of 3 John about?

John wrote this letter to a believer named Gaius. He instructed Gaius to be hospitable and helpful to fellow believers who were traveling through his area. These were probably groups of traveling Christian preachers and teachers. John also warned Gaius about a bad leader in the church there named Diotrephes. He also commended a good leader there named Demetrius. This may have been someone in Gaius’s congregation whom John wanted Gaius to support as a leader rather than Diotrephes, or he may have been the person who carried this letter to Gaius and John was introducing him to Gaius. If so, he was part of the same group that had come to John; they would be traveling back to where Gaius was and then traveling farther on.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “3 John” or “Third John.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Third Letter from John” or “The Third Letter John Wrote”. (See: How to Translate Names)

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### What is hospitality?

Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discouraged Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers. In 3 John, John encouraged Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### How does the author use family relationships in his letter?

The author used the terms **brother** and **children** in a way that can be confusing. The Old Testament scriptures often used the term **brothers** to refer to fellow Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to fellow Christians. Also, John called some believers his **children**. He meant this in a spiritual sense; these were believers whom he had taught to obey Christ.

John also used the term **Gentile** in a way that could be confusing. The scriptures often used the term **Gentile** to refer to people who are not Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to those who did not believe in Jesus.

### Which form of “you” occurs in this letter?

This is a personal letter from John to his friend Gaius. All instances of **you** and **your** in this letter refer to Gaius and are singular.

### How can I translate verses 6–7 in a logical order?

Verse 7 provides the reason for the action that John recommends in verse 6\. In some languages, it is more natural to state the reason first, and the action afterwards. If this would be more natural in your language, you can reverse the order of the sentences and then combine the verse numbers. (See: Verse Bridges)

For the ULT, reversing the sentences would look like this:

6–7 who have attested your love before the church. Because they went out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles, you will do well to send them on worthily of God.

## 3 John 1:6 (#2) (id: 179463)

**"to send on"**

Here, **to send on** is an idiom that means to provide people with what they need for a journey. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to supply with what they need for their trip”

* **Associated Passages:** 3JN 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

**"whom you will do well to send on worthily of God"** \- **"for they went out for the sake of the name, receiving nothing from the Gentiles"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. If you do so, you will need create a verse bridge in order to combine verses 6 and 7, as described in the Introduction to 3 John. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Because they went out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles, you will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of God”

**"receiving nothing from the Gentiles"**

John assumes that Gaius will know what he means by **receiving nothing from the Gentiles**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. This could mean: (1\) that the traveling believers had resolved not to accept any help from unbelievers. Alternate translation: “and they have resolved not to accept any help from unbelievers” (2\) that people who did not believe in Jesus would not help these traveling believers. Alternate translation: “and no unbelievers are assisting them”

## 3 John 1:8 (#1) (id: 179468)

**"Therefore"**

John is using the word translated as **Therefore** to introduce the result that should follow from the reason he gave at the end of the previous verse. Because **such ones** are accepting nothing from “the Gentiles” (verse 7\), believers ought to help them. Use a connector in your language that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “This is why”

## 3 John 1:8 (#2) (id: 179469)

**"we ourselves ought to support"**

John is stating the pronoun **we**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **ought**, to emphasize it. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **ourselves**. Alternate translation: “we certainly should welcome”

## 3 John 1:8 (#5) (id: 179472)

**"so that"**

Here, **so that** marks becoming **fellow workers** as a goal or purpose of supporting **such ones** as the traveling teachers. Use a natural way in your language that makes it clear that this is a purpose. Alternate translation: “and in this way”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## 3 John 1:9 (#5) (id: 179479)

**"does not receive us"**

John is using the word **us** to represent someone or something associated with himself and those with him. This could mean: (1\) that Diotrephes opposes providing hospitality and support to the traveling believers whom John endorses. (The word translated **receive** in this verse is the same one as in the phrase “he does not receive the brothers” in the next verse.) Alternate translation: “opposes helping these traveling believers” (2\) that Diotrephes does not accept John’s authority and so will not do what he says. Alternate translation: “rejects our instructions”

## 3 John 1:10 (#1) (id: 179481)

**"Because of this"**

**Because of this** indicates that what follows is a result of what came before. Because Diotrephes “does not receive” John and those with him (verse 9\), John will expose his evil works. Use a natural way in your language that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “Therefore” or “This is why”

* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship (ID: `33331@UWTranslationManual`)

## 3 John 1:10 (#2) (id: 179482)

**"if I come"**

John speaks as if he were uncertain about this, but he means that he is planning to come. If your readers might think that what John is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as a confident statement. Alternate translation: “when I come” or “at the time that I come”

## Luke 1:1 (#1) (id: 213301)

**"concerning the things that have been fulfilled among us"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “about those things that have happened among us”

## Luke 1:1 (#2) (id: 213302)

**"among us"**

Luke dedicates this book to a man named Theophilus. It is no longer known exactly who he was. But since Luke says in [1:4](https://ref.ly/Luke1:4) that he wants Theophilus to know that the things he has been taught are reliable, it appears that he was a follower of Jesus. So here the word **us** would include him.

## Luke 1:2 (#1) (id: 213303)

**"the ones having been"** \- **"eyewitnesses"**

The term **eyewitnesses** describes people who saw something happen personally, “with their own eyes.” The term describes such people by reference to something associated with sight, the eye. Alternate translation: “who … saw these things personally”

## Luke 1:3 (#1) (id: 213306)

**"having carefully investigated everything from the beginning"**

Luke provides this background information to explain that he was careful to find out exactly what happened.

Alternate translation: “because I have conducted careful research and interviews”

* **Associated Articles:** Background Information (ID: 33415)

## Luke 1:3 (#2) (id: 213307)

**"for you"** \- **"most excellent Theophilus"**

If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, it would be appropriate to use that form here. There are many other places in the book of Luke where your language might use formal **you**, and these notes will not address all of them. Rather, as you translate, use formal and informal **you** in the way that would be most natural in your language. The notes will address a few cases where a careful decision should be made between the two forms.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Formal or Informal

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Formal or Informal (ID: 33320)

## Luke 1:3 (#3) (id: 213308)

**"most excellent Theophilus"**

Luke is dedicating this work to **Theophilus**, and within his dedication, this is the conventional personal greeting. If it would be more customary in your language and culture, you could put this greeting in [1:1](https://ref.ly/Luke1:1) at the start of the dedication, at the very beginning of the book. Alternate translation: “To most excellent Theophilus”

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:3

## Luke 1:3 (#4) (id: 213309)

**"most excellent"**

Luke uses the term **most excellent** to address Theophilus in a way that shows honor and respect. This may mean that Theophilus was an important government official. In your translation, it would be appropriate to use the form of address that your culture uses for people of high status. Alternate translation: “Honorable”

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 1:3

## Luke 1:3 (#5) (id: 213310)

**"Theophilus"**

The name **Theophilus** means “friend of God.” It may describe this man’s character, or it may have been his actual name. Most translations treat it as a name.

## Luke 1:8 (#2) (id: 213327)

**"in his performing as priest"** \- **"in the order of his division"**

The phrase **must never** translates two negative words in Greek. The angel uses them together to emphasize how important it is that the child not drink wine or strong drink.

**"the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Gabriel uses them together to emphasize how certain it is that Jesus will always rule. Because Gabriel is making a proclamation, he is speaking in a form much like poetry. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

This is clear from the way that Gabriel responds positively and encouragingly to her, by contrast to the way he rebuked Zechariah in [1:18](https://ref.ly/Luke1:18) for his similar\-sounding question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I believe you, though I do not understand how this could happen”

**"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Once again Gabriel is speaking in a form much like Hebrew poetry. It would be good here as well to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a term other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating and clarifying the meaning of the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit will come to you, yes, the power of God will cover you like a shadow”

**"power of the Most High will overshadow you"**

It was the **power** of God that would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. It is not clear exactly how this happened, since Gabriel speaks as if God’s power had a shadow in order to describe it. But make sure that your translation does not imply that there was any physical or sexual union involved. This was a miracle. It might work well to retain Gabriel’s language and change the metaphor to a simile. Alternate translation: “the power of the Most High will cover you like a shadow”

However, it might be more natural in your language for someone who knows God well, as Simeon did, to address God using the informal form. Use your best judgment about what form to use.

Luke is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second\-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture. However, if your language does not put one direct quotation within another, you can translate this material as an indirect quotation.

## Luke 3:4 (#6) (id: 213779)

**""Make ready the way of the Lord,"**

These two phrases mean similar things. They are both telling people to make a good road for the Lord to travel on. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be helpful to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with another phrase that would show the relationship between them. Alternate translation: “Prepare a good road for the Lord to travel on, and do this by making sure that it follows a straight path”

## Luke 3:5 (#1) (id: 213781)

**""Every valley will be filled,"**

This is a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road that began in the previous verse. When people prepare the road for an important person who is coming, they make sure that the road is level by taking material from high places and using it to fill in low places. However, this is also a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. It is a statement similar to the one Mary makes in [1:52](https://ref.ly/Luke1:52), “He has thrown down rulers from their thrones and he has raised up the lowly.” Metaphors in Scripture can have more than one reference like this. So we recommend that you translate the words directly and not provide a plain explanation, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meanings of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.

**"Every valley will be filled"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form.

**""the crooked roads will become straight,"**

This too is both a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road and a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. Something that is **crooked** becoming **straight** and something that is **rough** becoming **smooth** can be seen as metaphors for repentance and a change in a person’s way of life. And so we recommend once again that you translate the words directly and not provide a plain explanation in the text of your translation.

**"You will worship"**

Here, it may not be clear whether to use the singular or plural form of **You** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular form of **You**, if your language marks that distinction. In general these notes will not discuss whether **You** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context. But they will address ambiguous cases such as this one.

## Luke 5:23 (#1) (id: 214075)

**"Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk"**

Jesus is using the form of a question in order to teach. He wants to make the scribes and Pharisees reflect on the situation and realize something. There are many implications. For example, these religious leaders may take the question in the sense, “Which is easier to get away with saying?” The answer would be, “Your sins are forgiven,” because people don’t expect visual proof of that, whereas if someone says, “Get up and walk,” and nothing happens, that proves the speaker doesn’t have the power to heal. Jesus likely intends the question in a different sense: “Which is the easier way to deal with a situation like this?” It appears that the man’s sickness has something to do with his sins, because Jesus forgives them. In such a situation, it would not be sufficient to say, “Get up and walk,” since that would address the effect but not the cause. To say, “Your sins are forgiven,” would deal with both the cause and the effect, so that would be the easier way to deal with the situation. There are many other implications that could also be drawn out as well—too many to include in the text of a translation. Since the question form is intrinsic to Jesus’ teaching method, you may wish simply to retain it in your translation. However, to show that he is teaching, not asking for information, you could introduce his question with a phrase that indicates its purpose. Alternate translation: “Think about this. Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk'?”

**"The ones being well do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness"**

Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here.

## Luke 6:9 (#2) (id: 214151)

**"I ask you if {it is} lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy"**

Jesus asks this question to get the Pharisees to admit that it is legitimate to heal on the Sabbath. The intent of the question is therefore rhetorical. Jesus is not trying to obtain information; he wants someone to admit that something is true. However, Jesus says, “I ask you,” so this question is not like other rhetorical questions that might appropriately be translated as statements. This one should be translated as a question.

**"you"** \- **"your"**

Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is now addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation.

Jesus is comparing someone to a grain merchant who measures out very generously. He could mean either God or other people.

It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, God will give you a generous amount” or “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, people will give you a generous amount”

**"They are like"**

These words are the beginning of Jesus’ comparison. His opponents complain about John being too austere, and they complain about him not being austere enough, just like children who complain when other children don’t dance with them, and then complain again when they don’t cry with them. Since Jesus explains this comparison in the next two verses, you do not need to explain it here in your translation.

In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, he is saying implicitly that Simon specifically has shown very little love for him. A further implication is that **one to whom little is forgiven** is actually someone who thinks he is better than others and mistakenly thinks he does not need to be forgiven for very much. Alternate translation: “a person like you who thinks that God has only had to forgive him for a few things does not show much love”

Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles”

**"the Twelve"**

Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits.

**"nor secret that will certainly not be known and come into visibility"**

The phrases **be known** and **come into visibility** mean similar things. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “and God will clearly reveal every secret”

**"So be careful how you listen"**

The phrase **be careful** does not mean that listening is dangerous. Rather, it means that people should listen carefully, because, as Jesus has just said, God wants to reveal spiritual secrets.

**"both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake"**

It seems unlikely that Jesus and his disciples would have gotten into a boat before they were planning to sail somewhere. So here Luke is probably describing the result before the reason. If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Let us go over to the other side of the lake.’ So they all got into a boat together”

Luke does not say specifically why Jesus allowed the demons to go into the pigs. But Jesus did not necessarily do so because the demons begged him. He may have had other reasons of his own. So it would probably be best to translate this in a neutral way, as ULT and UST both do, rather than beginning with a word such as “So,” which would imply that Jesus agreed to this because the demons begged him.

## Luke 9:22 (#8) (id: 214757)

**"and to be raised on the third day"**

In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the**third day**. To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day” or “day three,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” or “day two” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” or (if you translated in the first person) “and I will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, I will come back to life”

**"for us"** \- **"let us make"**

Since Peter wants to make it possible for Moses and Elijah to stay, when he says **for us**, he likely means “all six of us.” So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” use the inclusive form in that case. However, when Peter says **let us**, he is likely referring to himself and to James and John, so use the exclusive form of “us” in that case.

**"O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you"**

Jesus is speaking to something that he knows cannot hear him. He is addressing the entire **generation** of people who were living at that time, and they are not all present to hear him. He is doing this to show in a very strong way how he feels about this generation. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the crowd that has gathered there. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to the crowd, since they are included in the generation that Jesus is addressing.

Jesus is describing a situation that might have happened in the past but actually did not. He is doing this to express disappointment and regret about what is happening in the present. Be sure to translate this in such a way that your readers will know that this event actually did not happen but they will understand why Jesus is imagining it.

## Luke 10:15 (#1) (id: 214947)

**"you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you"**

Jesus is speaking to another city that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this once again to show in a very strong way how he feels about this city. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “The people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor them greatly”

## Luke 10:15 (#2) (id: 214948)

**"you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you"**

In Greek, the first word of the question that Jesus asks Capernaum is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **will you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum, do you really think that God is going to honor you greatly?”

**"you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you"**

To be **exalted** or “lifted up” is a spatial metaphor that indicates receiving honor. To be lifted all the way up **to heaven** (or “to the sky,” another possible meaning) means to receive very great honor.

**"What is written in the law? How do you read {it"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus may be using repetition for emphasis and clarity. Both phrases have to do with what the law says. The first phrase views this objectively in terms of what is written there, and the second phrase views this subjectively from the perspective of a person reading it. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if your readers might wonder why Jesus was saying basically the same thing twice. Alternate translation: “Tell me what answer a person would find to your question in the law of Moses.”

**"You will love"**

Here it may not be clear whether to use the singular or plural form of **You** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular forms of **You** **your**, and **yourself** in this verse, if your language marks that distinction.

This likely refers to the two activities that Mary and Martha have chosen to pursue while Jesus is present in their home. Alternate translation: “Mary has chosen the better activity”

The implication seems to be that God will also send prophets to the people living at this time because the people’s violent persecution of the prophets will constitute a conscious, deliberate rejection of God’s message that will provide grounds for definitive judgment.

## Luke 12:6 (#4) (id: 215328)

**"for two assaria"**

The word **assaria** is the plural of “assarion.” An assarion was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “two small copper coins” or “half an hour’s wages”

**"he will cut him in two"**

The expression **cut him in two** could mean one of two things, depending on how the word **unfaithful** is understood (See: next note): (1\) if **unfaithful** means “untrustworthy,” then the expression is probably figurative, since the master could not reassign this servant to less important responsibilities if he **cut him in two**. Alternate translation: “will punish him severely” (2\) if **unfaithful** means “unbelieving,” then the expression is more literal, since it would describe something that will happen when God judges the world.

## Luke 12:46 (#6) (id: 215492)

**"appoint his place with the unfaithful"**

The term that ULT translates as **unfaithful** could mean: (1\) “untrustworthy.” The meaning would be that the master will assign this servant to less important responsibilities, along with other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted with important ones. Alternate translation: “will give him unimportant responsibilities, like other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted” (2\) “unbelieving.” The master in the parable represents God, and Jesus would be speaking of what God will do, when he judges the world, to people who show by their disobedience that they do not have genuine faith.

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 12:46

## Luke 12:46 (#7) (id: 215493)

If not, you could translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. The meaning will depend on how you decided to translate **unfaithful** (See: previous note).

**"Hypocrites"**

The implication, which Jesus draws out in the rest of this verse, is that people who could understand the weather from signs such as wind and clouds also ought to be able to understand what God was doing through Jesus from the signs surrounding his ministry. So if they did not welcome him, it was not because they did not see or understand these signs. Rather, it was because they were pretending not to see or understand them.

This hypothetical situation is also an illustration designed to help the people understand that they should be welcoming Jesus.

## Luke 12:59 (#3) (id: 215547)

**"the very last lepton"**

A **lepton** was the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in this place and time. It was equivalent to about a tenth of an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “the very last penny” or “every bit of money that your creditor demands”

**"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not"**

Jesus is not asking this question for information or to get guidance about what he should do. Rather, he is using the question to challenge the Pharisees and lawyers to think about the meaning and purpose of the Sabbath. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as an imperative. Alternate translation: “If you think the law does not permit healing on the Sabbath, explain why.”

**"Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into a well, and he will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day"**

Jesus does not expect these religious leaders to tell him whether they would do this. Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool. He wants these religious leaders to recognize that on the Sabbath day, they themselves would do something to address a situation of suffering and need. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “If one of you had a son who fell into a well on the Sabbath, surely you would pull him out immediately. You would even do the same thing for your ox.”

This could mean: (1\) while all of the Pharisees and scribes who are grumbling are probably men, Jesus is describing what any person, man or woman, would likely do in this situation, and he is telling the parable for the whole crowd to hear. So the term **man** here may be generic. Alternate translation: “Which person among you” (2\) since Jesus speaks in his next parable of a woman doing something, he may be using a man and a woman in paired examples to offer a comprehensive teaching about the kingdom of God. In that case, the term **man** here would not be generic. Alternate translation: “Which of you men”

If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “But Abraham said”

## Luke 17:9 (#1) (id: 216174)

**"He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he"**

The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **does he?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Would he thank the servant for doing what he had been commanded to do?”

## Luke 17:34 (#4) (id: 216285)

**"The one will be taken, and the other will be left"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you could state who would do the actions. This could mean: (1\) the person who is **taken** may be one whom God takes out of a situation in which they would be destroyed, as God brought Lot out of Sodom, and the person who is **left** may be one who remains in a situation where they will be destroyed, like the people who remained in Sodom. That is the interpretation of UST. Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” (2\) in the parallel to this passage in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that the people living in Noah’s time “knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away” (Matthew 24:39 ULT). So the person who is **taken** may actually be one whom God destroys, and the one who is **left** may be one whom God spares and allows to remain alive.

The verb is feminine, so this means “two women.” (In [17:34](https://ref.ly/Luke17:34) and [17:36](https://ref.ly/Luke17:36), grammatically masculine forms are used, but conventionally in Greek that means that the people are not known to be all women; they could be men or women, so a general term such as “people” would be appropriate in those verses.)

To convey the vividness and immediacy of the disciples’ question, Luke uses the present tense in past narration here. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](https://ref.ly/Luke7:40). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him”

Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. He is not asking the ruler to explain why he used this term. Jesus is also not denying that he is God. Rather, he is challenging the ruler to reflect on whether, in light of God’s holiness, he should consider any human being to be **good**. The ruler apparently considers Jesus to be a **good** human being, and he wants to know how he can be **good** enough himself to earn God’s approval. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, and it may be helpful to combine that statement with the next sentence in the verse.

**"your"**

Jesus is reciting these commandments from the Scriptures, and the word **your** is singular because that is the way Moses spoke the commandments, since even though he gave them to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey them.

See how you translated this phrase in [9:22](https://ref.ly/Luke9:22).

Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” according to the way your culture reckons time.

A mina was a unit of weight equal to about half a kilogram. The term refers to silver coins of that weight. Each one was equal to what people would be paid for about four months’ work. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “he gave each of them a valuable silver coin” or “he gave each of them four months’ wages”

## Luke 20:4 (#1) (id: 216671)

**"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men"**

Jesus knows that John’s authority came from God, so he is not asking the Jewish leaders for information. However, this is not a rhetorical question that could be translated as a statement, for example, “Surely you must admit that God, not people, gave John the authority to baptize.” This is an actual question that Jesus wants the Jewish leaders to try to answer, because he knows that either way they answer, they will have a problem. So his words should be translated as a question. Alternate translation: “Was it God who told John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it?”

* **Associated Passages:** LUK 20:4

## Luke 20:4 (#2) (id: 216672)

## Luke 20:17 (#5) (id: 216722)

**""A stone that the builders rejected,"**

This is a quotation from Psalm 118, and it is a metaphor. It refers to the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing a plain explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.

## Luke 20:17 (#7) (id: 216724)

**"the head of the corner"**

The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building”

## Luke 20:18 (#1) (id: 216725)

**"Everyone having fallen on that stone will be broken to pieces"**

Jesus is applying the metaphor from the psalm to himself. He is speaking of people who reject him as Messiah as if they would fall over a stone and be injured. Jesus’ words are a direct allusion to the figurative language of Scripture, and he does not explain the metaphor to the people who are listening. So it would not be appropriate to change them into a plain explanation of the metaphor, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.

Once again it would not be appropriate to change Jesus’ words, which allude directly to the figurative language of Scripture, into a plain explanation of the metaphor. However, you could explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote.

## Luke 20:38 (#5) (id: 216810)

**"for all are alive to him"**

Interpreters understand this statement in various ways. One likely possibility is that Jesus is saying implicitly that after people die, while they are **dead** as far as other people are concerned, they are **alive** as far as God is concerned. That is because their spirits live on after death, and God is still able to relate to their spirits. Alternate translation: “because even after people die, God is still able to relate to them as living spirits”

**"they no longer dared to ask him anything"**

Here Luke uses a double negative in Greek for emphasis, saying **no longer** and “nothing.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “they still dared to ask him something.” If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here.

The implication in context is that Jesus’ enemies were afraid that if they continued to ask him difficult questions, his wise answers would continue to show how much more he understood than they did. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly.

**"How do they say that the Christ is the son of David"**

This does not seem to be a rhetorical question that Jesus is using as a teaching tool. Rather, it seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer. They had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement.

## Luke 20:42 (#5) (id: 216825)

**"The Lord said to my Lord"**

Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said **Lord** instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord”

## Luke 20:44 (#2) (id: 216832)

**"David therefore calls him ‘Lord"**

In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox, that is, is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David therefore addresses the Messiah respectfully as his Lord. But if the Messiah is his descendant, David should be the more respected person”

## Luke 20:44 (#3) (id: 216833)

**"And how is he his son"**

Like the question in [20:41](https://ref.ly/Luke20:41), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant?”

The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time.

## Luke 21:3 (#3) (id: 216856)

**"this poor widow put in more than all"**

Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others”

**"you did not lack anything, did you"**

The first word of this question in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer.

**"you did not lack anything, did you"**

Even though Jesus already knows the answer to this question and he is using it as a teaching tool, in this case he does want the disciples to reply. If you translated his words as a statement, for example, “I know that you did not lack anything,” then the disciples might seem to be interrupting him by speaking uninvited. Since Jesus did want them to speak, it would probably be most appropriate to present his words in the form of a question.

**"For"**

Jesus is giving the reason why the disciples should now be concerned about providing for and protecting themselves, as he said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](https://ref.ly/Luke22:16) for how you might do this.

## Luke 22:44 (#2) (id: 217175)

**"he was praying more earnestly"**

This could mean: (1\) Luke is using the comparative form of the adjective **earnest**, which has an adverbial sense here, with a superlative meaning.

**"his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground"**

This could mean one of two things. The first is more likely. (1\) It could describe the appearance of the drops. This would mean that Jesus had been under such stress that the small blood vessels that fed his sweat glands ruptured, and his sweat became mixed with blood. (This is a rare but well\-document medical condition known as hematohidrosis.) Alternate translation: “his sweat became mixed with blood and it fell to the ground in drops” (2\) It could describe the way in which the drops of sweat fell to the ground. Alternate translation: “he began to sweat so intensely that the sweat formed drops and fell to the ground as blood drops do”

## Luke 22:65 (#1) (id: 217251)

**"blaspheming {him"**

**Blaspheming** can have a technical sense, as it often does in this book. It can refer to a human being claiming to be God, as the Jewish leaders felt Jesus was doing in [5:21](https://ref.ly/Luke5:21). It can also refer to a human being wrongly denying that something is divine or of divine origin, as the Jewish leaders were afraid the people would consider them to be doing in [20:6](https://ref.ly/Luke20:6). By ironically suggesting that Jesus was not a true prophet, the soldiers actually were guilty of blasphemy in this technical sense. But the word can also have a general sense of “insult,” and that may be the sense in which Luke is using it here. Alternate translation: “insulting him”

## Luke 22:71 (#6) (id: 217275)

**"we ourselves have heard from his own mouth"**

The implications are that what Jesus has just said proves a charge of blasphemy by itself, because Jesus has claimed to be equal with God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we ourselves have heard him say that he is equal with God”

**"the whole multitude of them"**

The word **whole** is a generalization. Luke says in [23:51](https://ref.ly/Luke23:51) that at least one member of the Sanhedrin did not agree that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy and should be punished. Alternate translation: “the many members of the ruling council who wanted to condemn Jesus”

**"to accuse him"**

The chief priests and scribes accused Jesus of doing wrong things because they wanted Pilate to kill Jesus. But they were accusing him falsely, because Jesus had never done what they accused him of doing. For example, in [20:25](https://ref.ly/Luke20:25), Jesus had specifically said that the Jews could pay taxes to the Roman government. To make sure that your readers are not confused, you could state explicitly that these accusations were false. Alternate translation: “to accuse him falsely”

**"both Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that day"**

Luke does not say specifically why these two men **became friends**. This could mean: (1\) Pilate had shown Herod courtesy by respecting his jurisdiction over Jesus. Alternate translation: “Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had respectfully sent Jesus to Herod to judge him” (2\) they realized that they agreed in their opinion about Jesus. They both felt that he was not guilty of doing wrong, but they also felt they could mistreat him as a way of asserting their power and authority over someone the people considered a leader. Alternate translation: “Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because they had both responded to Jesus in the same way”

**"the people"**

This is a further reference reintroducing these participants, whom Luke first introduced subtly in 23:4\. It is not likely that Pilate asked a crowd to gather. Instead, the crowd was probably still there waiting to see what would happen to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the crowd of people that was still there”

## Luke 23:14 (#2) (id: 217311)

**"as turning the people away"**

Here Pilate uses a figurative term that is similar to the one that the council members use in [23:2](https://ref.ly/Luke23:2) when they accuse Jesus of “misleading” the Jewish nation, meaning that he was encouraging them to do wrong things. The slightly different term that Pilate uses to summarize their charges means that they accused Jesus of **turning the people away** from their duties to the Roman Empire. It does not mean that Jesus refused to welcome people who came to him for help. Alternate translation: “saying that he encourages the people to be disloyal to the Roman Empire”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Luke 23:14 (#3) (id: 217312)

**"I, having examined him before you"**

For emphasis, since he is declaring Jesus innocent, Pilate uses the personal pronoun **I** here when it would not ordinarily be required in Greek. If your language uses pronouns in this same way, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation.

## Luke 23:15 (#3) (id: 217319)

**"to us"**

Pilate means that Herod sent Jesus back not just to him and his soldiers, but also to the Jewish leaders who were the accusers in this trial. Since Pilate is speaking specifically to those leaders (he says in the previous verse, “You brought this man to me”), the word **us** includes the addressees. So it would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction.

## Luke 23:16 (#1) (id: 217321)

**"Therefore, having punished him, I will release him"**

Your readers may find this hard to understand. Since Pilate had found Jesus not guilty, he should have released him without punishing him. The implications are that Pilate punished Jesus anyway, even though he knew he was innocent, to try to satisfy the Jewish leaders. However, since Luke does not provide this explanation in his book, you probably should not add it to your translation. But you could make explicit that Pilate is saying he is not going to execute Jesus. Alternate translation: “So I will not execute him, but whip him, and then let him go”

## Luke 23:21 (#2) (id: 217338)

**"Crucify, crucify him"**

This is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him!”

**"For what evil did this one do"**

Pilate does not expect the crowd to tell him what Jesus has done wrong. Rather, he is using the question form to emphasize to the crowd that Jesus is innocent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

**"Therefore, having punished him, I will release him"**

See the note to this same sentence in [23:16](https://ref.ly/Luke23:16). Pilate should have released Jesus without punishment, because he was innocent. It seems that Pilate decided to punish Jesus anyway to try to satisfy the Jewish leaders. However, since Luke does not provide this explanation in his book, you probably should not add it to your translation. But you could make explicit that Pilate is saying he is not going to execute Jesus. Alternate translation: “So I will not execute him, but whip him, and then let him go”

## Luke 23:31 (#1) (id: 217380)

**"For if they do these things in the moist tree, what will happen in the dry"**

This is a figure of speech based on the idea that dry wood catches fire much more easily than moist wood. The fire, in turn, represents terrible things that people will experience. Jesus is saying that under the present relatively stable conditions, it was difficult for his enemies to arrest him and sentence him to death. In the future, conditions will become so desperate and chaotic that people will be able to do much worse things much more easily. He is probably referring to what conditions will be like during the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, which he described in [21:20–24](https://ref.ly/Luke21:20-Luke21:24). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this metaphor in your translation, and you could represent the metaphor itself as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “If people are able to do this when conditions are good, what will they do when conditions become very bad?”

**"Then the soldiers also mocked him, coming up {and} offering him vinegar"**

Luke does not say specifically in what way the soliders **mocked** Jesus by offering him **vinegar**, that is, the sour wine that was their common drink. This could mean: (1\) since Luke records in the next verse that the soldiers spoke of Jesus being the “king of the Jews,” the common drink may have been intended to show that they did not really believe he was a king, since a king would have drunk fine wine. Alternate translation: “Then the soldiers also mocked him by coming and offering him cheap sour wine, which was not what a real king would drink” (2\) the soldiers may have **mocked** Jesus just by **offering** him something to drink, but then not giving it to him, even though he would have been very thirsty.

These means implicitly all the people in the crowd that had come to watch the crucifixion who knew Jesus. It does not mean the disciples, since they had fled and were hiding. Rather, it means other people in Jerusalem who knew Jesus personally, which could include people such as the ones who lent him the colt in [19:30–33](https://ref.ly/Luke19:30-Luke19:33) and the one who provided the room for the Passover meal in [22:11–13](https://ref.ly/Luke22:11-Luke22:13).

Luke provides this background information about Joseph to help readers understand what happens in the next verse, when Joseph asks Pilate for permission to bury Jesus’ body.

## Luke 23:52 (#2) (id: 217483)

**"This one, having approached Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus"**

The implication is that Joseph requested the body of Jesus so that he could give it a proper burial. Ordinarily, to make crucifixion as gruesome a death as possible, the Romans left the dead bodies of people who had been crucified on the crosses to be eaten by wild animals, and they then burned whatever remained in the Valley of Hinnom where, as a note to [12:5](https://ref.ly/Luke12:5) explains, refuse was thrown and fires burned continually. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain why Joseph asked for Jesus’ body. You could also specify that Pilate gave Joseph permission to bury Jesus, as UST does. Alternate translation: “This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus so that he could bury it”

If your language uses multiple negatives for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You might express the emphasis in other ways, and it may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No body had ever before been put in that tomb”

This phrase can be understood in two different ways, depending on how the words in it are grouped together. Different versions of the Bible interpret this differently. If there is already a version of the Bible in your area, see how it translates this. You may wish to translate it in the same way. Otherwise, we recommend that you follow the reading of ULT. (1\) If the grouping is “he went away, to himself wondering,” then the meaning is as in ULT and UST. (2\) If the grouping is “he went away to himself, wondering,” then the meaning is that Peter went back to his own home. Alternate translation: “he went away to his home, wondering what had happened”

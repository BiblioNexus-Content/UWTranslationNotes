**"as a good soldier of Jesus Christ"**

Here Paul speaks as if Timothy were a **soldier** who fights for and serves **Jesus Christ**. A **good soldier** is one who obeys his commander even if that means suffering and pain.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as if you were a good soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander” or “as someone who faithfully serves Jesus Christ no matter what happens”

**"No one serving as a soldier is entangled in the affairs of life, so that he may please the one having enlisted him"**

Here Paul continues to speak about a **soldier** to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as a soldier focuses on pleasing his commander, so Timothy should focus on pleasing Jesus. To do so, he will have to avoid becoming **entangled in the affairs of life**. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:7) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:5-2Tim2:6), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is using a metaphor or giving an example. Alternate translation: “Imagine that you are a soldier.

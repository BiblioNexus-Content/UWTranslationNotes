He compares those who teach about the gospel with builders who construct a house on its foundation. These builders can use a variety of different materials to construct the house, and Paul lists six. The first three, <strong>gold, silver, precious stones</strong>, are more durable, while the last three, <strong>wood, hay, or straw</strong>, are less durable. It is clear that Paul is interested in durability, because of the next verse, where he states that all of these materials will be tested with fire (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13\">3:13</a>). By speaking this way, he indicates that those who proclaim more about the gospel can teach things that are more or less true and acceptable to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “if anyone teaches you more about the gospel with words that are acceptable to God or words that are not acceptable to God”</p><p>See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26686\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Biblical Imagery — Extended Metaphors</span></p>",

However, sometimes the meat could be sold to people, who would then eat it in their homes. In the next few chapters, Paul will speak about whether and how Christians should eat or not eat this meat.

For this story, see especially <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod13:17-Exod14:31\">Exodus 13:17–14:31</a>. God appeared to the Israelites as a pillar of cloud and fire, and he led them and protected them with this pillar of cloud and fire. To get out of Egypt, God led them to a sea called the “Red Sea” or the “Sea of Reeds.” When the king of Egypt came to take the Israelites back to Egypt, God worked through Moses to divide the water of the sea and make a path for the Israelites to travel through. When the king of Egypt tried to follow them, God sent the water back, and the Egyptian army drowned. Paul draws special attention to the <strong>cloud</strong> and the <strong>sea</strong> because of what he will say in the next verse.

The phrase <strong>all things</strong> does not mean that “love” <strong>believes</strong> everything it hears or <strong>hopes</strong> for everything that could happen. Rather, the point is that “love” <strong>believes</strong> in every situation and <strong>hopes</strong> at all times. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind <strong>all things</strong>in a way that more clearly refers to time or situation. Alternate translation: “It bears up in every situation, believes in every situation, hopes in every situation, endures in every situation”</p><p>See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span></p>",

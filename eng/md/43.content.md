**"the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ"**

John placed the two sentences in this verse next to each other without any connecting word in order to show a contrast between the law of Moses and the grace and truth of Jesus. This does not mean that the law of Moses did not have grace and truth. Rather, John is indicating that the grace and truth revealed by Jesus is more complete than that revealed in the law of Moses. Although God revealed himself and his will through the law of Moses, he did so much more clearly though Jesus, who is God in human form. Alternate translation: “the law was given through Moses.

**"The wind blows where it wishes"**

The word translated **wind** can also mean spirit. Jesus here speaks of the Holy Spirit, as if he were **wind**.

The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses it to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “the Messiah”

## John 3:14 (#1) (id: 210970)

**"And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness"**

In this verse, John records Jesus comparing his crucifixion to Moses lifting up a bronze snake. John assumes that his readers will know that Jesus is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, the Israelites complained against God, and God punished them by sending poisonous snakes to kill them. God then told Moses to make a bronze snake and raise it up on a pole so that whoever was bitten by one of the poisonous snakes and looked at the bronze snake would not die. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “And just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent on a pole when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness”

Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he knows that the condition is not true. He knows that the woman does not know the gift of God or who he is. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “You surely do not know the gift of God and who it is who is saying to you … Otherwise, you would have asked him”

**"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness"**

In this verse, John assumes that his readers will know that the crowd is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Exodus. In that story, the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron because they were hungry. God responded by providing a flake\-like food that fell from the sky and could be baked into bread. The people called this flake\-like food “manna.” (See: Manna) You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story.

John is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles”

**"to the Twelve"**

If your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known.

For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits.

If your language does not use this type of question, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You break the law yourselves and yet you want to kill me!”

Also, the prophet Jonah came **from Galilee** ([2 Kings 14:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:25)) and [Isaiah 9:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:1-Isa9:7) said that the Messiah would be a great light rising from Galilee.

**"the Father having sent me testifies about me"**

In addition to Jesus himself, God **the Father** also **testifies about** Jesus. Jesus thus implies that his testimony is true, because there are two witnesses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “my Father, who sent me, also brings evidence about me. So you should believe that what we tell you is true” or “my Father, who sent me, also testifies about me. Therefore, my testimony is true”

**"was a murderer from the beginning"**

Here, **the beginning** refers to the time when the first humans, Adam and Eve, sinned. It does not refer to the very beginning of time. The devil tempted Eve to sin and Adam sinned as well. Because they sinned, all living things die as part of the punishment for sin. Therefore, Jesus calls **the devil** a **murderer** for starting the process that brought death to the world.

**"Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes"**

The negative reaction of the Pharisees described in the following verses is based on their belief that, according to their religious law, Jesus’ actions were considered to be work.

## John 10:1–5 (#1) (id: 211982)

**""**

General Information:\\n\\nIn [10:1–5](https://ref.ly/John10:1-John10:5), Jesus speaks a parable, which he then uses for teaching purposes in [10:7–18](https://ref.ly/John10:7-John10:18). Here, the “shepherd” is a metaphor for Jesus and “sheep” is a metaphor for people. “His own sheep” are the people who follow Jesus, and the **thief**, **robber**, and “strangers” are the Jewish leaders, including the Pharisees, who try to deceive the people. Since Jesus does not explain the meaning of this parable here, you should not explain the metaphors within the parable itself.

**""**

Verses 35 and 36 are one sentence. In this sentence, Jesus argues by moving from a weaker reason to a stronger reason (an argument from the lesser to the greater). Based on the scripture he quoted in verse 34, Jesus argues that, since God calls humans **gods** in that verse, it is even more appropriate to call him God because he is the Son of God. You may need to change the order of the clauses in order for this idea to be clearer in your language.

**"If someone walks in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world"**

Here Jesus speaks about **someone** walking **in the daytime** in order to comfort his disciples who were worried about going to Judea. In this metaphor Jesus uses **the light of this world** to refer to himself, who has previously called himself “the Light of the World” in [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12) and [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5).This whole metaphor could mean: (1\) if Jesus and his disciples did God’s work during the limited time God had given him to work with them (**the daytime**), they would not fail (**stumble**) because Jesus was with them. This interpretation has a similar meaning to Jesus’ statement in [9:4](https://ref.ly/John9:4). Alternate translation: “If you do God’s work during the time I am here, you will succeed, because you are with me, the light of this world.” (2\) someone who acts according to God’s will (**walks in the daytime**) does not fail (**stumble**) because Jesus guides that person.

**"But if someone walks at night, he stumbles because the light is not in him"**

In this verse Jesus expands the metaphor from the previous verse about a person walking outside. In this metaphor Jesus uses **the light** to refer to himself, who has previously called himself “the Light of the World” in [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12) and [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5). This whole metaphor could mean: (1\) if his disciples tried to do God’s work after the limited time God had given him to be with them (the **night** which comes after “the daytime”), they would fail (**stumble**) because Jesus would not be with them. This interpretation has a similar meaning to Jesus’ statement in [9:4](https://ref.ly/John9:4). Alternate translation: “If you try to do this work after I have left, you will fail because I, the light, am not with you.” (2\) someone who does not act according to God’s will (**walks at night**) is an unbeliever who fails completely (**stumble**) because that person does not know Jesus. Alternate translation: “If someone does not act according to God’s will, he will fail because he does not know me, the light”

Jesus uses the **true vine** to refer to himself. As a **vine** is the source of life for its branches, so Jesus causes people to live in a way that pleases God and brings other people to believe in Jesus. Since the **vine** is an important metaphor in the Bible, you should translate the words directly or use a simile and not provide a plain explanation in the text of your translation.

## John 15:2 (#1) (id: 212627)

**"Every branch in me not bearing fruit,"** \- **"and every one that bears fruit,"** \- **"so that it might bear more fruit"**

Jesus speaks about people who claim to be his disciples but are not by continuing the metaphor of a vine. In this paragraph, Jesus uses **branch** to refer to both true and false disciples. He also uses **bearing fruit**, **bears fruit**, and **bear more fruit** to refer to living in a manner that pleases God, especially demonstrating the Christian qualities called the “fruit of the Spirit” in [Galatians 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “Everyone who claims to be my disciple but does not please God is like a branch in me that does not bear fruit … and every person who pleases God is like a branch that bears fruit … so that he might be like a branch that bears more fruit”

## John 18:11 (#1) (id: 212883)

**"The cup which the Father has given me, should I certainly not drink it"**

**Jesus** is using the form of a question to add emphasis to his statement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I should certainly drink the cup that the Father has given to me!”

**"The cup which the Father has given me, should I certainly not drink it"**

Here Jesus uses **cup** to refer to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter\-tasting liquid that God would give him to **drink**. If this use of **cup** and **drink** would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “My suffering which the Father wants me to endure, should I certainly not endure it”

**"first to Annas, for he was the father\-in\-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year"**

Usually there would only have been one high priest, but at this time the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea, and it caused a controversy. One Roman official had appointed **Annas**, but ten years later another official deposed him and caused **Caiaphas** to be **high priest** instead. However, the Jews still considered Annas to be **high priest**. It would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible for your readers. Alternate translation: “first to the high priest Annas, for he was the father\-in\-law of Caiaphas, who was the other high priest that year”

Pilate, the Roman governor, was not a Jew. The Jewish leaders believed that they would become ceremonially unclean if they entered the house of someone who was not a Jew.

## John 21:25 (#2) (id: 213298)

**"not even the world itself to have enough room for the books being written"**

John exaggerates to emphasize that Jesus did very many good things. If this would confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language to show this emphasis. Alternate translation: “a very large amount of books about these miracles would be written”

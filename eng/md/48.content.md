**"not from men"**

Here, the word **from** indicates source. The phrase **not from men** means that humans are not the source of Paul’s apostleship and that he was not commissioned or appointed to be an apostle by human beings. If it would help your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “not sent out by people” or “not because I was appointed and sent by a group of people”

## Galatians 1:1 (#7) (id: 391303)

## Galatians 1:1 (#8) (id: 391304)

**"God the Father, the one having raised him from the dead"**

The phrase **the one having raised him from the dead** gives further information about **God the Father**. It is not making a distinction between **God the Father** and **the one having raised him from the dead** as if they are two separate entities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases more clear. Alternate translation: “God the Father, who is the same one who made Jesus Christ live again after he died” or “God the Father, who caused Jesus Christ to live again after he had died”

By using these two rhetorical questions, Paul is not asking the Galatians for information, but is using the question form for emphasis and to engage his readers' thinking. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “For I do not seek to persuade men, but instead I only seek the approval of God! I am not seeking to please men!” or “For I do not seek the approval of men, but instead I only seek the approval of God! I am not seeking to please men!”

**"am I now trying to persuade men, or God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still pleasing men"**

**"them"**

Most Bible scholars think that **them** here refers to meetings with two different groups of people with whom Paul met while in Jerusalem, one meeting with a large number of Christians from Jerusalem and a smaller meeting with just the apostles. The phrase **but privately to the ones seeming to be important** is only describing the latter meeting, as it is only this meeting which is relevant to what Paul is trying to communicate here. When translating the word **them**, make sure that you use a word or phrase that allows for both meetings to be included.

## Galatians 2:2 (#10) (id: 391421)

**"lest I might run—or had run—in vain"**

By saying **lest I might run—or had run—in vain** Paul is not expressing doubt regarding the validity or accuracy of the message about Jesus that he preached. Rather, he is referring to the possibility that if the apostles of Jesus were to publicly disagree with his message, then it would or could cause people to no longer believe it, in which case his work of teaching people the message about Jesus would or could have no lasting results. Translate this phrase in a way that avoids making it appear as if Paul is questioning the content or validity of the message he proclaims. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate more explicitly what this phrase means.

**"I might run—or had run"**

Here, Paul uses the word **run** to mean work. Paul specifically means working for the advancement of the gospel. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Galatians’ minds the image of a runner who is running a race in order to win a prize. If this image is familiar to people in your culture, consider using this metaphor. If this image is not familiar to your readers, consider stating this idea in plain language.

Here, the word **But** is introducing an idea that is in contrast to an idea that was presented in [2:2](https://ref.ly/Gal2:2). Paul is probably presenting the fact that **not even Titus … was forced to be circumcised** as being in contrast to the idea in [2:2](https://ref.ly/Gal2:2) that he might have “run in vain” (labored in vain).

He means that they pretended to be fellow believers, but their intent was to observe what Paul and the other believers were doing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

## Galatians 2:10 (#1) (id: 391467)

**"only that we should continue to remember the poor"**

Here, the word **only** introduces an exception clause that qualifies Paul’s statement at the end of [2:6](https://ref.ly/Gal2:6) where Paul said that the leaders in Jerusalem added nothing to his message (meaning they did not require him to do or teach anything else). Use an appropriate form in your language so that it does not appear that Paul is making a statement here that contradicts his statement at the end of [2:6](https://ref.ly/Gal2:6).

**"poor"**

Paul is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor”

**"But"**

Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast. The actions that Paul will describe in [2:11–13](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:13) are in contrast to the decision that was made in [2:1–10](https://ref.ly/Gal2:1-Gal2:10). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.

The phrase **opposed him to his face** is an idiom which means to confront someone. It could refer specifically to: (1\) confronting someone directly, face to face. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “I confronted him directly” or “I confronted him face to face” (2\) confronting someone in public.

If it would help your readers the reason Peter was **afraid** can be stated explicitly.

**"If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews"**

This is the beginning of a direct quotation in which Paul quotes what he **said to Cephas**. Some Bible scholars think this quote ends at the end of this verse, while other Bible scholars think that this quotation continues until the end of [2:21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:21). Some Bible scholars think that part of Paul’s words in [2:15–21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:15-Gal2:21) could be him summarizing what he said to Peter and the Jews who were present. The ULT uses quotation marks from this point through the end of [2:21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:21). Use a natural way in your language for indicating that Paul’s words from here to the end of [2:21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:21) are a quotation. If you decide that Paul is quoting himself only through the end of this verse, then use a natural way in your language for indicating that Paul’s words from here to the end of this verse are the complete, direct quotation.

**"If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews"**

Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphatically rebuke Cephas and to help Cephas understand the hypocrisy of his actions. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation, and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are a Jew, and live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, and so it is very hypocritical for you to force the Gentiles to live like Jews!” or “You are a Jew, and live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, and so it is very wrong for you to force the Gentiles to live like Jews!”

Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement.

When Paul says **We**, it could be: (1\) inclusive if Paul is still addressing Peter. If you decide that this verse is a continuation of the quotation that began in [2:14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14), then **We** is inclusive because Paul is still addressing Peter and would be including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch.

**"sinners from the Gentiles"**

The word **sinners** was used by Jews as a synonym for non\-Jews because non\-Jews did not have or adhere to the law of Moses. Paul is not saying that only non\-Jewish people are **sinners**. The rest of this letter will make clear that both Jews and non\-Jews are sinners and need God’s forgiveness. If it would help your readers, you could indicate explicitly that the term **sinners** is what Jews called non\-Jews. Alternatively, you could state the meaning in plain language.

**"works of the law"** \- **"works of the law."** \- **"works of the law"**

Paul is using the possessive form to describe the types of **works** to which he is referring. He is specifically referring to works of the Mosaic law.

**"so that"**

The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause.

**"For by works of the law not any flesh will be justified"**

Here, the word **For** re\-introduces and re\-states the reason why Cephas and the other Jewish believers **believed in Christ Jesus**. They **believed in Jesus Christ** because **by works of the law no flesh will be justified**. The phrase **by works of the law no flesh will be justified** repeats in slightly different words the earlier phrase in the verse which says **no man is justified by works of the law**. If it would not be natural in your language to re\-introduce the reason after the result, you could re\-introduce and re\-state the result.

**"no man"** \- **"any flesh"**

Both the words **man** and **flesh** refer to people in general and include all people, both Jewish people and Gentile people, and refer to people of all ages and ethnicities. The phrases **no man** and **any flesh** exclude all people, both Jewish people and Gentile people. Paul is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that no person, Jew or Gentile, can be justified by obeying the law. Since Paul explains this truth in this passage, you do not need to explain its meaning further here, but make sure to use words or phrases when translating the words “man” and “flesh” which indicate that these words refer to all people of all ages and ethnicities.

**"But"**

Here Paul uses the word **But** to introduce new information into his ongoing explanation of why justification is through faith in Christ and not through obeying the law of Moses.

**"we"** \- **"were"** \- **"found"**

Here, **we** could be: (1\) inclusive if Paul is still addressing Peter. If you decide that this verse is a continuation of the quotation that began in [2:14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14) then **we** is inclusive because Paul is still addressing Peter and would be including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (2\) exclusive if you decide that Paul’s quotation of his words to Peter ended at the end [2:14](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14).

## Galatians 2:17 (#9) (id: 391518)

**"is} Christ then a minister of sin"**

The phrase **is Christ then a minister of sin** is a rhetorical question. Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

**"I again rebuild those things which I destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor"**

Paul speaks of no longer thinking it is necessary to obey all the laws of Moses as if he were destroying the law of Moses. When he speaks of rebuilding **those things**, he is referring to going back again to acting like and teaching that it is necessary to keep the laws of Moses. Paul is saying in this verse that he would be sinning if he **again** tried to go back to living as if it were necessary to obey the laws of Moses after becoming convinced that it was not necessary to obey them in order to please God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly, or you could use a simile.

## Galatians 2:19 (#4) (id: 391525)

**"died to the law"**

Here, the phrase, **died to the law** could: (1\) be a metaphor in which **died to the law** refers to Paul’s new relationship to the law of Moses which he experienced when he realized that trying to obey the law of Moses was not a valid way of earning God’s approval; and as a result he chose to die to the law, by which he means he was released from the power and control of the law of Moses and no longer subjected himself to it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “died to being under the control of the law and am no longer subject to it” or “stopped being subject to the authority of the law of Moses” (2\) be a metaphor in which the phrase **died to the law** means “considered as dead to the requirements of the law of Moses through union with Christ.” The phrase **died to the law** would then refer to believers’ vicarious death with Christ through their believing in him and their consequent union with him which they have as a result of their faith in him. (See [Rom 7:4](https://ref.ly/Rom7:4) and [Gal 4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5)) Alternate translation: “died to the requirements of the law through my union with Christ”

## Galatians 2:19 (#8) (id: 391529)

**"I have been crucified with Christ"**

The phrase **I have been crucified with Christ** is a metaphor. Paul is not saying that he literally died with Christ. Paul is using this metaphor to express the reality that, as a result of his faith in Christ and the subsequent union with Christ that his faith has brought about, God now views Paul as if he had died with Christ on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile.

**"I have been crucified with Christ"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the law was the reason Christ had to be put to death. Roman soldiers put Jesus to death, but in context Paul is explaining that it was God’s righteous requirements given in the law that made it necessary for Christ to die so that people could be forgiven.

## Galatians 2:20 (#1) (id: 391531)

**"I no longer live, but Christ lives in me"**

Here, the phrase **I no longer live, but Christ lives in me** is a metaphor which means that Paul no longer lives for himself and his own self\-motivated purposes and desires, but rather, he now lets Christ’s will direct his actions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or you could express the meaning plainly.

So when Paul says **I live by faith that is in the Son of God** he means that he now lives his life by means of having faith in God’s Son. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. See how you translated the similar phrase “through faith in Jesus Christ” in [2:16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16).

**"for if righteousness {is} through the law, then Christ died for nothing"**

Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is not true. Paul stated two times in [2:16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:16) that no person is made righteous before God by obeying the law of Moses. Also, Paul knows that Christ died for a definite purpose. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certainly false, and if your readers might misunderstand this and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could translate his words as a negative statement. If your language does state things as a hypothetical possibility that the speaker is trying to prove false, then use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “since we know that righteousness is through faith in Christ and not through the law of Moses, or else Christ would have died for nothing” or “for we know that God considers us righteous because we believe in Christ and not because we keep the law of Moses, or else Christ would have died for nothing”

The phrase **publicly portrayed** is a metaphor in which Paul is either referring to the practice at that time of someone publicly drawing a picture for people to see or the practice of someone posting a public announcement for people to read. If the first option is what Paul intends then he is referring to his preaching the good news about Jesus as if it were a clear picture that the Galatians had seen with their eyes and if he intends the second option then is referring to his preaching the good news about Jesus as if it were a public announcement which he had posted and which the Galatians had read. Both options have the same general meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

The original word that Paul used, which is translated as **experienced** by the ULT, could refer to: (1\) experiencing bad things such as suffering. If this is what Paul means here, then he is referring to the suffering that the Galatians believers experienced when they were persecuted. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses and not because of trusting in Christ, did you not suffer so many things needlessly? I certainly hope that you did not suffer like that needlessly” (2\) the spiritual privileges and blessings that the Galatian believers had experienced such as receiving God’s Spirit and God “working miracles” among them, both of which are mentioned in the next verse. If your language does not allow you to use a neutral term but rather requires a more specific term, you could specify that the things the Galatians experienced were good things. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if the good things God has done for you were because you obeyed the laws that God gave to Moses and not because you trusted in Christ, then the good things God has done for you have been wasted. I certainly hope that the good things you have experienced have not been wasted” (3\) both good things and bad things and be referring to both the persecution that the Galatians had experienced and the spiritual blessings that they had experienced. Because it is not known for sure the type of things to which Paul is referring, if possible you should try to use a neutral term or expression. You could then translate this rhetorical question as the ULT does or with a similar neutral phrase such as “Did all the things that happened to you not cause you to think about them?”

## Galatians 3:4 (#5) (id: 391569)

**"if indeed it was really for nothing"**

The phrase **if indeed it was really for nothing** shows contingency regarding his rhetorical question, **Have you experienced so many things for nothing**, and shows that Paul retains hope for the Galatians. Paul hopes they will not make the **many things** that they have **experienced** be **for nothing** by obeying the false teaching that they must obey the laws of Moses such as the dietary laws and laws about circumcision. Paul is making a hypothetical statement to help his readers recognize the serious implications of following the teachings of these false teachers. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “if indeed it was really for nothing that you experienced so many things, but I hope with you that this is not the case”

## Galatians 3:4 (#6) (id: 391570)

**"if indeed it was really for nothing"**

The phrase **if indeed it was really for nothing** is a rhetorical question. Paul is using the question form here to help the Galatians think about what he is saying and demonstrate his continued hope that they will decide against the teachings of the false teachers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

**"Therefore, the one providing the Spirit to you and working miracles among you, {is it} by works of the law, or by hearing of faith"**

This entire verse is a rhetorical question. Paul is using the question form here to teach the Galatians a truth by engaging their reasoning. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “God who gives you his Spirit and does miracles among you does not do these things because you obey the law of Moses. Surely you must know that God gives you these blessings because you believed the good news about the Messiah when you heard it”

**"sons of Abraham"**

People who have faith in God, as Abraham did, are here spoken of as if they were Abraham’s **sons**. Paul does not mean that people who have faith in God are Abraham’s biological descendants but, rather, he is saying that they share a spiritual similarity to him because they believe in God. Therefore Paul calls them **sons of Abraham**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile.

## Galatians 3:13 (#1) (id: 391622)

**"redeemed"**

Paul uses the metaphor of a person buying back lost property or buying the freedom of a slave to illustrate the meaning of God sending Jesus to pay for people’s sins by dying on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

**"Now a mediator is not for one"**

In this verse Paul is proving to the Galatian believers that God’s promise to Abraham is superior to the law that he gave Moses. What Paul means by saying **a mediator is not for one** is that a mediator is not needed when one person is speaking with another person directly. Paul is implicitly expressing to the Galatian believers that the promise to Abraham is superior to the law because it was not given through a mediator but, rather, God gave the promise directly to Abraham.

**"but"**

Here, the word **but** is introducing the phrase **God is one**, which is an allusion to a phrase in Deuteronomy 6:4\. The Galatians believers would have known that Paul was referencing this scripture. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that the word **but** is introducing a reference from Scripture. Alternate translation: “but as Moses wrote in Scripture,”

**"to make alive"**

The phrase **to make alive** could refer to: (1\) both eternal life in the future and to making people spiritually alive in the present. Paul is probably referring to both here since in this letter Paul discusses the important role of the Holy Spirit and the fact that the Holy Spirit is given through faith and not the law.

**"have been baptized into Christ"**

Paul speaks of being **baptized into Christ** as if **Christ** were a physical location into which someone could be baptized.

## Galatians 3:27 (#6) (id: 391741)

**"have been baptized into Christ put on Christ"**

By speaking of baptism, Paul could be describing all of the things which belong to a believer's initial conversion experience. Paul would then be associating all of them with one part of their conversion experience, water baptism, in which case baptism is an abbreviated way of referring to conversion and the things that are part of it such as belief in Christ, baptism, and receiving Holy Spirit. If you decide that this is what Paul means here, and if it would help your readers, you could indicate this explicitly, or you could explain this in a footnote if you are using them. Alternate translation: “God has saved have put on Christ” or “have believed in Christ have put on Christ” or “have experienced God’s salvation have put on Christ”

**"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"**

Here, the word **for** introduces the reason for why, if someone is a believer in Christ, it is as if there is no longer **Jew nor Greek** or **slave** or **free** or **male** or **female**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase, which follows the word **for**, gives the reason for the result that the first part of this verse describes. Alternate translation: “Because you are all one in Christ Jesus, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female”

## Galatians 3:28 (#2) (id: 391744)

**"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"**

Paul says that people who believe in Christ are no longer divided by racial, social, or gender distinctions but, rather, now have **one** common identity **in Christ**. Human distinctions now cease to be significant because believers are united in a new spiritual identity, which is being **in Christ**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “For you who are united by your faith in Christ Jesus, it is now as if there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female” or “For you who are united by belief in Christ Jesus, it is now as if there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female”

**"one"**

Here, Paul uses the word **one** to indicate that all believers share an equal position because of the new identity they have by being **in Christ**. (Paul explains his statement from the previous verse that all believers have put on Christ, meaning that they have a new and common identity derived from and centered on Christ).

## Galatians 4:6 (#4) (id: 391792)

**"sons"**

Paul speaks of the Galatian believers as though God were their biological, physical father. He means that these people have a father\-son relationship with God because they trust in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. See how you translated the word **sons** in [4:5](https://ref.ly/Gal4:5), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “the spiritual children of God”

**"into our hearts"**

Here, the word **hearts** refers to the innermost part of a person. Paul is describing the innermost part of a person by association with their physical heart. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent term from your culture that is used to describe the center of a person’s inner being or you could use plain language.

## Galatians 4:6 (#7) (id: 391795)

**"Abba, Father"**

The word **Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father** and which the Jews used to address their fathers. Paul writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers. Since the Aramaic word **Abba** is followed by the Greek word **Father**, it is best to transliterate **Abba** and then give its meaning in your language, as Paul does.

Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true.

Paul is asking the Galatian believers to become like himself and not act as if the law of Moses has authority over their lives.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

**"because of a weakness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you"**

Here, Paul states that it was a physical illness that previously caused him to proclaim the gospel to Galatians. This could mean that: (1\) Paul was already in Galatia when illness caused him to remain there to recover, which gave him time and opportunity to proclaim the gospel to the Galatians. (2\) because of a physical illness, Paul went to Galatia to recover from his sickness. While there, he proclaimed the gospel to the Galatians. Because Paul does not explicitly state what provided the opportunity for him to preach the gospel, you should not further explain what Paul says here about his sickness but, rather, you should use a general expression.

The phrase **having torn out your eyes, you would have given them to me** could: (1\) be an idiom indicating the great love and devotion which the Galatians formerly had for Paul. In Paul’s time the eyes were considered a person’s most precious possession, so if it were possible for a person to take out their eyes and give them to another person, this would indicate great love. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

## Galatians 4:16 (#2) (id: 391847)

**"speaking truth to you, have I become your enemy"**

The phrase **speaking truth to you, have I become your enemy** is a rhetorical question in which Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to show the Galatian believers his disappointment with them and cause them to think about what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “as a result of my speaking the truth to you, you are acting as if I have become your enemy.”

However, because of the serious nature of the false teaching which the Galatians were being tempted to accept, combined with Paul’s physical distance from the Galatians, he felt that he needed to write to them and firmly and sternly correct their false thinking with the hope that they would not believe or follow false teaching.

## Galatians 4:27 (#9) (id: 391909)

**""the children of the desolate one {are} many more"**

"The prophet Isaiah wrote this scripture passage during the time in which Jerusalem and its people had been conquered by the Babylonian army and the people taken away to Babylon. Isaiah is speaking of the city of Jerusalem as it was at the time of his writing, when it was without most of its original inhabitants. He compares the empty city to a **desolate** woman, a woman whose husband has left her, and he speaks of the inhabitants of Jerusalem as if they were **children**. In this passage from Isaiah 54:1, Isaiah is picturing Israel as a wife who is abandoned by her husband, which is God. Having **children** in this context refers to having inhabitants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

**"you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise"**

The point of this comparison is that the Galatian believers (who are referred to as **brothers**) are **like Isaac** because both **Isaac** and the Galatians are **children of promise**, meaning that they both owe their birth to God’s supernatural working. Isaac’s physical birth came about as a result of God’s supernatural intervention, and the Galatian believers spiritual birth came about as a result of God’s supernatural intervention. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning plainly.

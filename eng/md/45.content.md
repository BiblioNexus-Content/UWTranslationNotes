These questions emphasize the hypocrisy of the Jews, who thought they were superior to non\-Jews because they knew the law of Moses. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate Paul’s words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way.

**"For"**

**For** here indicates that [2:25–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:25-Rom2:29) provide another reason why both Jews and Gentiles will be punished for their sins, as stated in [2:12](https://ref.ly/Rom2:12). Paul is arguing against the idea that circumcision guaranteed a Jew’s salvation, which some Jews believed. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason.

**""**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nIn [3:27–31](https://ref.ly/Rom3:27-Rom3:31) Paul uses a series of rhetorical questions and answers in order to emphasize that God alone makes people righteous through faith in Jesus. Like in [3:1–9](https://ref.ly/Rom3:1-Rom3:9), Paul is speaking as if he were a non\-Christian Jew when he asks the rhetorical questions, but he is speaking as himself when he answers those questions.

**"the father of circumcision to the one {being} not only from the circumcision, but to the ones also following in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham in uncircumcision"**

Paul uses **father of circumcision** to indicate that Abraham is both the physical ancestor and spiritual ancestor of Jewish people who believe in Jesus.

Some ancient copies say “we have peace,” which makes sense, since [5:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:5) are a list of blessings that belong to those people who have been **justified by faith**. If the reading **let us have peace** is correct, this phrase may be indicating Paul’s desire that his fellow believers continue to experience the peace they have with God. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST.

Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Because”

**"if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive branch, were grafted into them, and became partakers with them of the richness of the root of the olive tree"**

Paul continues using the metaphor of a **tree** to speak about how God rejected unbelieving Jews and accepted non\-Jews to be part of his people instead. The **olive tree** represents God’s people. The **branches** that **were broken off** represent Jews who don’t believe in Jesus. The **wild olive branch** represents non\-Jewish people who believe in Jesus. The **richness** represents the blessings God gives his people. The **root** represents either the ancestors of the Israelites (as in the previous verse) or the Jewish people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor as a simile. See also the discussion of this metaphor in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “if some of the Jews were rejected, like branches are broken off of a tree, and you, being foreigners were joined to God’s people as wild olive branches are grafted onto a tree, and you received the blessings of the first Israelites as part of God’s people, as branches receive the nutrients of the root of the olive tree”

**""**

The **root** represents either the ancestors of the Israelites (like in [11:16](https://ref.ly/Rom11:16)) or the Jewish people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor as a simile. See also the discussion of this metaphor in the General Notes for this chapter.

    "content": "<h1>Introduction to 3 John</h1><h2>Part 1: General Introduction</h2><h3>Outline of the book of 3 John</h3><ol><li><p>Introduction (1:1)</p></li><li><p>Encouragement and instructions to show hospitality (1:2–8)</p></li><li><p>Condemnation of Diotrephes (1:9–10)</p></li><li><p>Instructions to imitate what is good (1:11)</p></li><li><p>Praise for Demetrius (1:12)</p></li><li><p>Conclusion and greetings (1:13–15)</p></li></ol><h3>Who wrote the book of 3 John?</h3><p>The letter does not give the name of the author. The author only identified himself as <strong>The elder</strong> (1:1). The letter was probably written by the apostle John near the end of his life, after he had written the Gospel of John and the letters 1 John and 2 John. In this letter, John referred to himself as “the elder.” This may have been because of his old age, or because he was a leader in the church, or both, since both were true. If possible, in your translation use a word in your language that can refer to both old age and church leadership.</p><h3>What is the book of 3 John about?</h3><p>John wrote this letter to a believer named Gaius. He instructed Gaius to be hospitable and helpful to fellow believers who were traveling through his area. These were probably groups of traveling Christian preachers and teachers. John also warned Gaius about a bad leader in the church there named Diotrephes. He also commended a good leader there named Demetrius. This may have been someone in Gaius’s congregation whom John wanted Gaius to support as a leader rather than Diotrephes, or he may have been the person who carried this letter to Gaius and John was introducing him to Gaius. If so, he was part of the same group that had come to John; they would be traveling back to where Gaius was and then traveling farther on.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “3 John” or “Third John.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Third Letter from John” or “The Third Letter John Wrote”. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26805\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">How to Translate Names</span>)</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>What is hospitality?</h3><p>Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discouraged Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers. In 3 John, John encouraged Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.</p><h2>Part 3: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>How does the author use family relationships in his letter?</h3><p>The author used the terms <strong>brother</strong> and <strong>children</strong> in a way that can be confusing. The Old Testament scriptures often used the term <strong>brothers</strong> to refer to fellow Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to fellow Christians. Also, John called some believers his <strong>children</strong>. He meant this in a spiritual sense; these were believers whom he had taught to obey Christ.</p><p>John also used the term <strong>Gentile</strong> in a way that could be confusing. The scriptures often used the term <strong>Gentile</strong> to refer to people who are not Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to those who did not believe in Jesus.</p><h3>Which form of “you” occurs in this letter?</h3><p>This is a personal letter from John to his friend Gaius. All instances of <strong>you</strong> and <strong>your</strong> in this letter refer to Gaius and are singular.</p><h3>How can I translate verses 6–7 in a logical order?</h3><p>Verse 7 provides the reason for the action that John recommends in verse 6. In some languages, it is more natural to state the reason first, and the action afterwards. If this would be more natural in your language, you can reverse the order of the sentences and then combine the verse numbers. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26824\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Verse Bridges</span>)</p><p>For the ULT, reversing the sentences would look like this:</p><p>6–7 who have attested your love before the church. Because they went out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles, you will do well to send them on worthily of God.</p>",

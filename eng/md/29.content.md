## Joel 1:1 (#2) (id: 499728)

**"The word of Yahweh that was"**

Joel is using the term **word** to mean "the message that Yahweh gave" by association with the way words are used to communicate messages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The message that Yahweh gave”

## Joel 1:1 (#3) (id: 499729)

**"The word of Yahweh that was"**

This is an idiom meaning that Yahweh spoke or communicated his message in some way to the prophet Joel. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The message of Yahweh that came” or “The message that Yahweh spoke”

## Joel 1:2 (#1) (id: 499730)

**"Hear this, you elders, and listen, all of the dwellers of the land"**

See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of how Hebrew poetry consisted of paired phrases that meant basically the same thing. Decide as a translation team how you will represent this poetry in your translation throughout the book of Joel. Alternate translation: “Hear this, you elders! Yes, listen, all of the dwellers of the land!”

## Joel 1:2 (#2) (id: 499731)

**"Has this been in your days or in the days of your fathers?"**

Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “This has not happened in your days or in the days of your fathers!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:2 (#4) (id: 499733)

**"your fathers"**

Joel is not referring to the literal **fathers** of the Israelites whom he is addressing. He is using that term to mean their ancestors. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your ancestors”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:3 (#1) (id: 499734)

**"and your sons to their sons, and their sons to the generation after"**

Joel is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and let your sons recount about it to their sons, and let their sons recount about it to the generation after”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: `33267@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:3 (#2) (id: 499735)

**"to your sons, and your sons to their sons, and their sons"**

Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both male and female children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “to your children, and your children to their children, and their children”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: `33276@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:3 (#3) (id: 499736)

**"Recount about it to your sons, and your sons"**

The imperative **Recount** and the word **your** are plural here because Joel is addressing the “elders” and “dwellers” mentioned in the previous verse. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural (ID: `33319@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:4 (#1) (id: 499737)

**"The residue of the cutting locust, the swarming locust has eaten, and the residue of the swarming locust, the hopping locust has eaten, and the residue of the hopping locust, the destroying locust has eaten"**

Joel is not referring to specific locusts of these types. He means locusts of these types in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “The residue of the cutting locusts, swarming locusts have eaten, and the residue of the swarming locusts, hopping locusts have eaten, and the residue of the hopping locusts, destroying locusts have eaten”

See: Generic Noun Phrases

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:4

In the General Introduction to Joel, see the discussion of the litany form and how you might format this verse in your translation to show that Joel is using that form.

See: Litany

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Litany (ID: `33289@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:4 (#3) (id: 499739)

**"The residue of the cutting locust, the swarming locust has eaten, and the residue of the swarming locust, the hopping locust has eaten, and the residue of the hopping locust, the destroying locust has eaten"**

The terms **cutting**, **swarming**, **hopping**, and **destroying** describe different kinds of locusts. Interpreters are not certain specifically what kinds of locusts these were. You may wish to use more general expressions in your translation. Alternate translation: “The residue of one kind of locust, another kind of locust has eaten, and the residue of that kind of locust, yet another kind of locust has eaten, and the residue of that kind of locust, still another kind of locust has eaten”

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: `33408@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:5 (#1) (id: 499740)

**"Wake up, drunkards, and weep! And wail, all of the drinkers of wine, upon the sweet wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth"**

See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of places such as this where the speaker describes a result before giving the reason for it. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “The sweet wine has been cut off from your mouth, so wail upon it, all of the drinkers of wine”

## Joel 1:5 (#2) (id: 499741)

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:5 (#3) (id: 499742)

**"from your mouth"**

Since Joel is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “from your mouths”

See: Collective Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: `33324@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:5 (#4) (id: 499743)

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:6 (#4) (id: 499747)

**"my land"**

Since Joel and the people he is addressing live in the same land, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **my**. Alternate translation: “our land”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:6 (#5) (id: 499748)

**"and without number"**

Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “and in huge numbers”

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:6 (#7) (id: 499750)

**"Its teeth {are} the teeth of a lion,\\nand the fangs of a lioness {are} to it"**

These two phrases, **Its teeth {are} the teeth of a lion,\\nand the fangs of a lioness {are} to it**, mean similar things. Joel is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Its teeth are as strong and sharp as the teeth of a lion” or “Its teeth, like the teeth of a lion, can tear through anything”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:6 (#8) (id: 499751)

* **Associated Articles:** Possession (ID: `33303@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:7 (#1) (id: 499752)

**"It has made my vine into a waste and my fig tree into splinters"**

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:7 (#2) (id: 499753)

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:7 (#3) (id: 499754)

**"Stripping, it has stripped it"**

Joel is repeating the verb “strip” in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “It has stripped it completely”

See: Reduplication

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Reduplication (ID: `33308@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:7 (#4) (id: 499755)

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:8 (#1) (id: 499757)

**"Mourn"**

The imperative **Mourn** is feminine singular because Joel is telling the community to mourn as it would as if it were a young woman whose fiancé had died. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural imperative.

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOL 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:8 (#2) (id: 499758)

**"like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth"**

The point of this comparison is that just as a virgin dresses in sackcloth to express her grief, so the Israelites should mourn to express their grief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “like a virgin dressed in sackcloth to express her grief for the husband of her youth”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joel 1:8 (#5) (id: 499761)

**"the husband of her youth"**

Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **the husband of her youth**, he means the fiancé to whom a young woman was betrothed. The word **virgin** indicates that this woman was not yet married, but in this culture, engagement was tanatmount to marriage and a fiancé was considered a **husband**. You could express this relationship with your own culture’s characteristic terms if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the fiancé of her youth”

## Joel 2:20 (#6) (id: 499899)

**"And his stench will rise and his odor will rise"**

These two phrases mean the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if this might be unclear in your language, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And his stench will rise, yes, his odor will rise”

## Joel 2:20 (#7) (id: 499900)

**"he has been great in doing"**

This expression means “he has in some way done more than would be expected.” The implication is that the locust swarm has perhaps destroyed more crops than it ordinarily would, or that the army that will invade will be more destructive than usual. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “he has caused excessive destruction”

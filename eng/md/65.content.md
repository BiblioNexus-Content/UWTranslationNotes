## Jude 1:1 (#1) (id: 260404)

**"Jude"**

In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Jude, am writing this letter” or “From Jude”

**"a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James"**

**"of Cain"**

Here Jude compares the false teachers to **Cain**. Jude assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Genesis. In that story, Cain made an unacceptable offering to God, and God rejected his offering. As a result he became angry and was jealous of his brother Abel, because God had accepted Abel’s offering. Cain’s anger and jealousy led him to murder his brother. God punished Cain by banishing him from farming the land. Additionally, at the time Jude wrote this letter, Jews considered Cain to be an example of someone who taught other people how to sin, which is what these false teachers were doing. You could indicate some of this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story.

In that story, Balaam was hired by wicked kings to curse the Israelites. When God did not allow Balaam to do so, Balaam used wicked women to seduce the Israelites into sexual immorality and idol worship so that God would punish them for their disobedience. Balaam did these wicked things because he wanted to be paid by the wicked kings, but he was eventually killed by the Israelites when they conquered the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story.

    "content": "<h1>Introduction to Ezra</h1><h2>Part 1: General Introduction</h2><h3>Outline of Ezra</h3><ol><li><p>The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1–2:70)</p></li><li><p>The people rebuild and dedicate the temple in Jerusalem (3:1–6:22)</p></li><li><p>More exiles return; Ezra teaches the Law of Yahweh (7:1–8:36)</p></li><li><p>The problem of the people marrying foreigners, and how it is solved (9:1–10:44)</p></li></ol><h3>What is the Book of Ezra about?</h3><p>The book of Ezra is about how the people of Israel returned from Babylon and tried to worship Yahweh again as the law required. To do this, they needed to rebuild their temple so that they could sacrifice to Yahweh. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26284\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Temple</span>)</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>The book of Ezra is named for the priest Ezra who led the first group of Jews out of exile and back to Judah. Translators can use the traditional title “Ezra.” Or they might choose a clearer title, such as “The Book about Ezra.”</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?</h3><p>Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners because he knew that this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25728\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">False God</span>)</p><h3>Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?</h3><p>Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the land of Israel. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done.</p><h2>Part 3: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>How does the Book of Ezra use the term “Israel”?</h3><p>The book of Ezra uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25879\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Israel</span>)</p><h3>Are the events in the Book of Ezra told in the order that they actually happened?</h3><p>Some of the events in the Book of Ezra are not told in the order that they happened, but are grouped according to theme. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of chronological order.</p>",

So here the book is presenting some events out of chronological order. That is, it is telling about some things that happened later, before finishing the story of what happened at this time. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:24\">4:24</a> the book will bring readers back to where it left off in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:5\">4:5</a>, and then, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:1\">5:1</a>, it will describe how work on rebuilding the temple did resume under the reign of Darius. But first it gives accounts here of how the enemies of the Jews continued to oppose them under two later kings, Ahasuerus (described in this verse) and Artaxerxes (described in verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:7-Ezra4:23\">7–23</a>). The purpose may be to show that the Jews were wise to refuse the help that leaders from other nations offered, as described in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:3\">4:1–3</a>. Since those leaders were actually enemies of the Jews, as they demonstrated by opposing them under one king after another, their offer was not sincere and they could not be trusted. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “In fact, they continued to oppose them under later kings.

The term <strong>completing</strong> by itself here seems similarly to have the meaning of “building.” <strong>Repairing</strong> here could also mean “digging out.” Either way, this is a reference to preparing foundations so that buildings can be set up on them.

In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:10\">5:10</a>, in their letter to Darius, Tattenai and his associates use “we” when they report that they were the ones who asked this question.

Other ancient versions say “they,” and it will likely be clearest for your readers if you translate the phrase in that way. Alternate translation: “they said to them, ‘What are the men&apos;s names’” or “they said to them, ‘Who are the men’” It is also possible that the verse is not reporting a question in direct speech, but is simply describing what was said as a statement.

In reality, besides ruling over the former Assyrian Empire, Darius was also king of Persia. Persia had conquered Babylon, which had previously conquered Assyria. This made the king of Persia to be the king of Assyria as well. It was unusual to refer to Darius as the king or ruler of Assyria. Ezra may have referred to him in this way to contrast Darius’ actions with those of the former rulers of Assyria, who had treated the Jews very cruelly. Those earlier Assyrian rulers were the ones who had conquered the northern tribes of Israel and deported them to other lands. It was for this reason that the northern tribes lost their identity and were no longer a distinct people group.</p>",

As is common in ancient genealogies, this list almost certainly does not include all of the generations between Aaron and Ezra. Aaron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:5\">7:5</a>) was the first high priest under the law of Moses and the first to serve in the tabernacle. Azariah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:3\">7:3</a>) was the first high priest to serve in the temple that Solomon built, which this book describes in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11\">5:11</a>. Seraiah was the last high priest to serve in that temple. The Babylonians executed him when they conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple. The names in the list are arranged so that there will be seven generations between Aaron and Azariah, and seven generations between Azariah and Ezra, with Seraiah listed as the last generation before Ezra. If you have the freedom to use formatting creatively in your translation, you could make the implicit information about Aaron, Azariah, and Seraiah explicit and format this genealogy in a way that will highlight its purpose and design.

Therefore, the king allows Ezra to return to Judea to teach the people about God’s law. Many people go with him.

One way to read it is: “Then I separated 12 from the leaders of the priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten from their brothers.” But since <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:18\">8:18</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:19\">19</a> specifically identify Sherebiah and Hashabiah as Levites, they could not have been leaders of the priests. An ancient Greek version of the book of Ezra says “and” before Sherebiah, so that this is a list of 24 men in total. Another way to read the Hebrew is as in the ULT, which also results in a list of 24 men. Both of these translations agree with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:30\">8:30</a>, which says that “the priests and the Levites” received the silver and gold and objects that Ezra weighed out to them. It will likely be clearest for your readers if you translate the verse in one of the latter two ways. Alternate translation: “Then I selected 12 leaders of the priests, along with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their fellow Levites.”</p><p>See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26819\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Textual Variants</span></p>",

The whole was a burnt up offering to Yahweh&quot;</strong></p><p>The book assumes that readers will recognize that there are two types of offerings here. The bulls, rams, and lambs are offerings of the first type. They were offered in order to express a desire to be in good standing with God by creating an aroma, the smell of roasting meat, that was considered to be pleasing to God. These were completely burned up. The goats are the second type of offering. As in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra6:17\">6:17</a>, the goats were a <strong>sin offering</strong>. These were offered as a request for forgiveness from God. As explained in Leviticus 4:22–26 and 6:24–30, only the fat of these goats was burned up. The meat of these goats was for the priests to eat. The phrase <strong>The whole was a burnt up offering</strong> is a summary that includes the two types of offerings, one that was completely burned up and the other that was partially burned up. Therefore the final sentence means, “All of this was properly subjected to fire on the altar as sacrifices to Yahweh.” The book assumes that readers know this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “offered as burnt offerings to the God of Israel 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs, and as a sin offering 12 male goats.

The Jewish people had done this before and God had punished them for it. God forbade this type of marriage because it caused the people to worship other gods.

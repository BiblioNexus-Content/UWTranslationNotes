    "content": "<h1>Introduction to Malachi</h1><h2>Part 1: General Introduction</h2><h3>Outline of Malachi</h3><p>1:1 Title 1:2–5 Yahweh will punish the wicked: Edom 1:6–14 Judeans not bringing acceptable sacrifices 2:1–9 Priests must teach and apply the law faithfully 2:10–16 Yahweh is concerned for justice: no divorce 2:17–3:5 Yahweh is concerned for justice and will punish evildoers 3:6–12 Judeans not bringing proper tithes 3:13–15 Yahweh will punish the wicked, despite what Judeans are saying 3:16–4:6 Yahweh will bless and protect those who fear him</p><p>The overall structure of the book follows a pattern called “chiasm,” which Hebrew writers considered to be particularly elegant in poetry and literature. There are six main parts to this structure. The chiasm pattern is ABCCBA. In terms of theme, the first and sixth parts are found in (1:2–5 and 3:13–15), the second and fifth parts match (1:6–14 and 3:6–12), and the third and fourth parts match (2:10–16 and 2:17–3:5). There is also an excursus, a special message to the priests (2:1–9), and an epilogue telling how the people responded to the message of the book and what Yahweh promised them (3:16–4:6).</p><h3>What is the book of Malachi about?</h3><p>The book of Malachi contains prophecies that address the Jews who had returned to Judah from exile in Babylon. At that time, the Jews were discouraged even though they had finished building a new temple. The wonderful things that previous prophets had promised for Judah had not yet happened. The Persian Empire still ruled over them. As a result, they no longer were concerned about the law or worshiping Yahweh. These prophecies rebuke the Judeans for not living as the law taught and for not bringing proper tithes and sacrifices. But the prophecies also assure the Judeans that Yahweh will ultimately do everything that he promised to do.</p><h3>Who wrote the book of Malachi?</h3><p>The description in the book title (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:1\">1:1</a>) could either be translated “the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of Malachi” or “the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of my messenger.” The last expression in that sentence also occurs in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:1\">3:1</a>, where the context indicates that it should be translated as “my messenger.” However, the expression could well be the name of the man in the book title. That man would be the prophet who delivered these messages on behalf of Yahweh. However, we do not know anything else about this man—where he lived, what family he came from, etc. Translating the expression as a name is the most common interpretation, and that is the interpretation that the ULT and these notes follow. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the same interpretation as the ULT.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>This book traditionally has been titled “Malachi” or “The Book of Malachi.” Translators may decide to call it something like “The Sayings of Malachi” or “The Messages that Malachi Brought.”</p><h2>Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>The “day of Yahweh”</h3><p>The book of Malachi speaks about the “day of Yahweh” in 3:2–5 and 3:17–4:6. It also calls it “the day that is coming” and “the day of his coming,” and Yahweh calls it “the day that I am preparing.” All of these are references to the time when Yahweh will come and judge people. He would remove those who have wickedly sinned and bless those who have trusted in him. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25646\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Day of the Lord</span>)</p><h2>Part 3: Translation Issues</h2><h3>“But you say”</h3><p>In each of the six thematic sections of the book, the prophet makes a statement that challenges the people and gets their attention. Its meaning is not immediately clear. The prophet then anticipates how the people will respond. He introduces their likely response with the phrase “But you say” (1:2, 1:6, 1:7, 1:13, 2:14, 2:17, 3:7, 3:8, 3:13). After saying how he expects they would respond, he then explains what his provocative statement meant. This was a common practice of Jewish public speakers in this time period (and also in New Testament times). The phrase “But you say” occurs throughout the book as Malachi anticipates and answers objections. It would be helpful to translate the phrase consistently so that your readers can appreciate the method he is using to challenge the Judeans.</p><h3>Yahweh of Armies</h3><p>This is an important title of God that is used more than 20 times throughout the book of Malachi. It reminds the listeners of the great power that Yahweh has to judge and punish all nations. Be sure to translate it consistently throughout the book so that your readers can appreciate the emphasis that Malachi places on it.

Yahweh did this because Phineas zealously opposed the worship of foreign gods. That is what Yahweh means here by “I gave them to him for fear.” He is saying, in other words, “because he worshiped me exclusively and devotedly.” Yahweh was punishing the Israelites for this idol-worship with a plague that was killing many of them, but he ended the plague because of what Phineas did. So this was a covenant of <strong>peace</strong> (Yahweh was no longer hostile to the Israelites). It was also a covenant of <strong>life</strong> (Yahweh was no longer punishing the Israelites with death). The word <strong>life</strong> may also reflect that this was a permanent covenant that would not end. The notes to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal2:5\">2:5</a> suggest ways to translate these statements.</p><h2>Translation Issues</h2><h3>And did he not make one (2:15a)</h3><p>Here are two views Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1) The word <strong>one</strong> refers to the close connection a husband and wife have. Alternate translation: [And did not God make you one with your wife?] (2) The word <strong>one</strong> refers to God. Alternate translation: [And did not the one God make you]</p><h3>and a remnant of spirit {was} to him? (2:15b)</h3><p>Here are two views, among many, that Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1) These words mean that a husband and wife are united in body and spirit. Alternate translation: [God made you to become united with your wife in body and spirit] (2) These words mean that the bodies and spirits of a husband and wife belong to God. Alternate translation: [and you and your wife belong to God]</p><h3>“and one {who} covers over his garment with violence” (2:16)</h3><p>Here are three views Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1) it means that husband and wife Malachi is speaking as if <strong>violence</strong> were a substance with which a person could cover a <strong>garment</strong>. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The idea of complete covering conveys emphasis. Alternate translation: [and one who acts very violently] (2) The word <strong>violence</strong> refers to harsh actions that could include actions other than divorce. Alternate translation: [and one who acts violently] (3) The word <strong>violence</strong> refers to violent or cruel actions which a person conceals. Alternate translation: [and one who conceals their violence]</p>",

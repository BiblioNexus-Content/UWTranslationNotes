### What is the book of Exodus about?

Exodus continues the story of the previous book, Genesis. The first half of Exodus is about how Yahweh made Abraham’s descendants into a nation. This nation, which would be called “Israel,” was meant to belong to Yahweh and worship him. The second half of Exodus describes how God gave the Israelites his law through Moses. The law of Moses told the Israelites how to obey and worship Yahweh properly.

The book of Exodus tells how the Israelites were to build the Dwelling. The Dwelling was a tent where Yahweh would be among his people. The Israelites worshiped and sacrificed animals to Yahweh at the Dwelling. (See: Law of Moses and Tabernacle)

### How should the title of this book be translated?

“Exodus” means “exit” or “departure.” Translators may translate this title in a way that can communicate its subject clearly, for example, “About the Israelites Leaving Egypt” or “How the Israelites Left the Land of Egypt.” (See: How to Translate Names)

### Who wrote the book of Exodus?

The writers of both the Old and New Testaments present Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Exodus. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

### Why did Moses write so much about God delivering or rescuing the people of Israel?

Moses wrote much about God rescuing his people from the Egyptians to show that Yahweh is very powerful. Egypt was a very powerful nation in the region at that time, but Yahweh was still able to free the Israelites from the Egyptians. Also, by rescuing the Israelites, Yahweh showed that he had chosen them as his people and that they should worship him.

### How does the book of Exodus show the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham?

The book of Exodus shows God beginning to fulfill his promise to Abraham. In Genesis, God promised Abraham that he would have many descendants and that they would become a large nation. When God rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians, he took them to Mount Sinai. There he made a covenant with them, and they became the nation that belonged to Yahweh.

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### What was the Jewish Passover?

The Jewish Passover was a religious festival. Yahweh commanded the Israelites to celebrate it every year. Passover was a time to remember how God rescued Israel from the Egyptians. The first Passover meal was eaten in the evening just before they left Egypt. (See: Passover)

### What was the law of Moses to the people of Israel?

The law of Moses instructed the people of Israel about what Yahweh required them to do as his people. In the law, God told the people how they should live so that they would honor him. He also instructed them about their need to offer animal sacrifices. God required these sacrifices so that he could forgive their sins and continue living among them. The law also described the duties of the priests and told how to build the Dwelling.

### What did it mean that Israel was to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” ([19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6) ULT)?

Israel was a holy nation because Yahweh separated them from all other nations to belong to him. They were to honor and worship him only. This made them different from all the other nations of the world; the other nations worshiped many false gods.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### Thus says Yahweh

This phrase is used many times in the Old Testament to introduce Yahweh’s speech. Your team should pick a standard translation. See chapter 4 Intro for more.

### Pharaoh’s stubborn heart

Between chapters 4 and 14, there are 18 cases where Pharaoh’s heart is described as strong (11x), heavy (6x), or hard (1x), and one case where the Egyptians’ hearts are described as strong. These are metaphors for being stubborn, that is, being unwilling to obey Yahweh or even to do what is clearly in his own and Egypt’s best interest. Many cultures have similar metaphors, but not all will use the same body part. Within these cases, six times there is a neutral description that Pharaoh was stubborn, without saying anyone made him so ([7:13](https://ref.ly/Exod7:13), [7:14](https://ref.ly/Exod7:14), [7:22](https://ref.ly/Exod7:22), [8:19](https://ref.ly/Exod8:19), [9:7](https://ref.ly/Exod9:7), [9:35](https://ref.ly/Exod9:35)); three times Pharaoh makes himself stubborn ([8:15](https://ref.ly/Exod8:15), [8:32](https://ref.ly/Exod8:32), [9:34](https://ref.ly/Exod9:34)); and ten times Yahweh makes Pharaoh/the Egyptians stubborn ([4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21), [7:3](https://ref.ly/Exod7:3), [9:12](https://ref.ly/Exod9:12), [10:1](https://ref.ly/Exod10:1), [10:20](https://ref.ly/Exod10:20), [10:27](https://ref.ly/Exod10:27), [11:10](https://ref.ly/Exod11:10), [14:4](https://ref.ly/Exod14:4), [14:8](https://ref.ly/Exod14:8), [14:17](https://ref.ly/Exod14:17)).

### Why are the details of the construction of the Dwelling in Exodus 25–32 repeated in Exodus 35–40?

In Exodus 25–32, God describes exactly how the Dwelling was to be built. The details were repeated in Exodus 35–40 in the description of the actual construction. This showed that the people were careful to do exactly as God commanded.

### Are the events in the order that they actually happened?

Most, but not all, of the events in the book of Exodus are told in the order that they actually happened. Translators may need to make it clear when the events are in an unusual order.

### What does it mean that God “lived” among his people?

The book of Exodus presents God as living in the Dwelling among the nation of Israel. God is everywhere, but he lived among the Israelites in a special way. God dwelled with the Israelites because they belonged to him. He promised to lead them and bless them. In return, the people were to worship him and honor him.

## Exodus - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 718573)

Exodus 1 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is intended to form a smooth transition from the last chapter of the book of Genesis.

* v. 1–7: Jacob’s family grows
* v. 8–22: Pharaoh oppresses the Israelites and tries to limit the Israelites’ growth

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Israel’s growth

Israel grew in number. This was the beginning of God’s fulfilling his promises to Abraham. It also caused the Pharaoh to worry that there would be more Israelites than Egyptians, with the result that the Egyptians would be unable to defend themselves against so many people. Pharaoh tried to kill all of the male babies so they would not become soldiers who fought against him. (See: Fulfill and Covenant)

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

* “All of the descendants of Jacob were 70 in number” This number included both Jacob’s children and grandchildren. It may cause confusion, but it is important to remember Jacob only had 12 sons.
* Starting from verse 7, the terms **Hebrews** and **sons of Israel** both refer to the Israelite nation or people group.
* God blesses the Hebrew midwives for lying to the wicked Pharaoh. Translators should not attempt to hide this. They showed that they feared God by disobeying a wicked order in order to preserve the lives of God’s people.
* Pharaoh is a specifically Egyptian word for their kings (and queens).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:7

## Exodus 1:7 (#4) (id: 392147)

**"were fruitful and propagated"**

The birth of children to the Israelites is spoken of as if they were plants that were producing fruit and causing new plants to grow around them.

**"his people"**

The people whom the king rules over and who are also part of his group (probably shared ethnicity, tribe, or clan) rather than the Israelite group are spoken of as if they belonged to the king. This is an instance of the possessive of social relationship.

See: Possession

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:9
* **Associated Articles:** Possession (ID: 33303)

## Exodus 1:9 (#3) (id: 392158)

**"his people"**

There is some ambiguity as to whom exactly Pharaoh was addressing. It could have been: (1\) the people who lived in Egypt, the Egyptians or (2\) some group of “his people” like his advisors, generals, nobles, or friends and family. Even if option 1 is meant, it is quite possible that he actually spoke to some smaller group of representatives, as in option 2\.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 1:9

## Exodus 1:9 (#5) (id: 392160)

**"Behold"**

Beginning from **behold** and extending to the end of [1:10](https://ref.ly/Exod1:10) is a direct quotation of what the king said. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes.

## Exodus 1:10 (#1) (id: 392161)

**"let us act wisely"** \- **"the ones hating us,"** \- **"with us"**

**"toward him,"** \- **"he multiplies,"** \- **"and he"** \- **"adds himself"** \- **"and he fights"** \- **"and he leaves"**

Here, **him, he**, and **himself** refer to the Israelite people. The pronouns agree grammatically with the singular “people” in the original. This occurs in many places in Exodus. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the plural, as in the UST.

## Exodus 1:10 (#3) (id: 392163)

**"lest he multiplies, and it happens that a battle occurs"**

The king suggests a combination of two hypothetical events: 1\. There are even more Israelites, 2\. There is a battle. These are followed by a series of undesirable consequences: 3\. The Israelites join an enemy, 4\. The Israelites attack the Egyptians, 5\. The Israelites leave Egypt. While the series of consequences is also technically hypothetical, the king’s language indicates that if 1–2 happen, then 3–5 are certain. Use language that makes it clear that the first two events are hypothetical and that the next three are consequences that could be expected if the first two events happen.

## Exodus 1:16 (#1) (id: 392186)

**"And he said"**

In the UST, the phrase and **the king said**, is combined with “spoke” from [1:15](https://ref.ly/Exod1:15) (ULT) because the verb for “say” is used twice before he speaks. Having two speech verbs may be strange in some languages. If it would be unnatural to say that the king spoke or said words twice, you may leave one off.

## Exodus 1:16 (#2) (id: 392187)

**"When you assist"** \- **"as midwives and you see"** \- **"then you shall cause"** \- **"to die"**

This phrase is more logically connected to the statements in verse 21\. It describes the result of the midwives fearing God with a general statement. If it would be more natural in your language, you could rearrange verses 20–21 so that the reason (verses 21\) comes before both the general and specific results.

From **You shall** to the end of the verse is a direct quote of Pharaoh’s speech. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it could be translated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “And Pharaoh commanded all of his people to throw every baby boy into the river, but to let every girl live.”

## Exodus - Chapter 2 Introduction (id: 718574)

Exodus 2 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–10: Moses’ birth and early life
* v. 11–15: Moses’ attempted intervention and flight
* v. 16–22: Moses settles in Midian
* v. 23–25: God sees the Israelites’ plight

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Covenant

At the end of the chapter, God begins to relate to the Israelites based on his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

### Identification of participants

* Moses is the only participant named in most of this chapter. This is because many of the participants play very minor roles and because this part of the story is focusing on Moses’ life.

### Moses’ heritage

In the first part of this chapter, Pharaoh’s daughter recognizes Moses as being a Hebrew, but in the last part of this chapter, the Midianites believe him to be an Egyptian.

### Ironic situations

* While Pharaoh tried to diminish the power of the Israelites by killing all of their baby boys, God used Pharaoh’s own daughter to save Moses.
* Moses believes he is meant to be the rescuer of his people, but they reject him. Ultimately, Moses was correct, but the people rejected him at this point (See: Acts 7\).

This means she stood far enough away so that she would not be noticed, but close enough to see the ark. Use a word that expresses this sort of distance in your language.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 2:4

## Exodus 2:4 (#2) (id: 392221)

**"at a distance"**

## Exodus 2:5 (#1) (id: 392224)

**"And"** \- **"came down"**

**Came down** may be literal or figurative, as important places are often considered to be in a higher place. This means she came from her home, probably Pharaoh’s palace. If a perspective is required for Pharaoh’s daughter, you may choose go or come as works best in your language. “Come” is better as the scene is at the river and she comes to the scene location. However, you also need to consider your language’s way of introducing new participants.

This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. It seems to have been said loud enough for the baby’s sister to hear.

**"and call for you a nursing woman from the Hebrews"**

This is a suggestive question. The child’s sister is hopeful that Pharaoh’s daughter does not yet have a plan for the baby beyond saving his life. However, it is still a true question, for without Pharaoh’s daughter’s permission, the child’s sister will not be able to fetch the woman. If your language has a way of forming questions that are also suggestions, use it here.

In Hebrew, these are the same verb. In English, they could be translated as “settle,” which can mean to dwell in a certain place, but it can also mean to lower one’s body into a seated position. This could mean: (1\) Moses lived in Midian. He sat by this well one day. This may have been the well for the town he lived in. (2\) Moses lived in Midian. His home was by this well. (3\) Moses was a wanderer. He was in Midian and sat by this well when the next event occurred.

## Exodus - Chapter 3 Introduction (id: 718575)

Exodus 3 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is one conversation in which Yahweh begins to commission and send Moses to rescue the Israelites.

This chapter records one of the most important events in the history of the Israelite people: the revelation of the name Yahweh at the burning bush. (See: reveal)

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### God’s holiness

God is so holy that people can not look upon him without dying. This is why Moses covered his eyes. It is also why he took off his shoes. (See: Holy and Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### Yahweh

The name Yahweh is the personal name of God, which he revealed to Moses. Yahweh is probably related to the phrase “I am” which he tells Moses in verse 14\. Some translations use all capitals to set this apart: “I AM.” Great care must be taken in translating the phrase “I am that I am.” (See: Yahweh)

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

### Participants

“The angel of Yahweh,” “Yahweh,” and “God” all appear to be speaking to Moses and interacting with him from the burning bush. Furthermore, God says that his name is “I AM.” (See note above on Yahweh and I AM.) Yahweh and God are the same, while there is speculation about who the angel of Yahweh is.

## Exodus 3:1 (#5) (id: 392299)

**"the mountain of God"**

This is an associative possessive. This mountain was associated with God in some way. In [Exodus 3:12](https://ref.ly/Exod3:12) God tells Moses that he and the Israelites will serve him on this mountain. Later in the story, this promise is fulfilled, and it is where God makes his covenant with Israel and gives them the 10 Commandments. So it may have been called **the mountain of God** in retrospect (as Moses probably wrote this book sometime after the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness). However, it is possible that the mountain was already somehow associated with God’s presence or worship before Moses went there with the flock.

## Exodus 3:2 (#3) (id: 392302)

**"and behold, the bush was burning in the fire, but the bush was not being consumed"**

The word **behold** here shows that Moses saw something that was very different from what he expected. He expected the bush to be burnt up completely by the fire. Consider using an interjection in your language that expresses that what follows is a surprise.

**"being consumed"**

Here, **being consumed** means being eaten completely until gone. In the case of fire, this is a metonym for burning completely until gone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “destroyed by the fire”

**"Let me turn aside and see this great sight! Why does the bush not burn up"**

This is a direct quote. It’s not specified who Moses spoke to; he may have been alone or with a group of shepherds or his family. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

## Exodus 3:5 (#1) (id: 392307)

**"for the place on which you are standing, it is holy ground"**

This is the reason Moses must stop coming close to the burning bush and take off his sandals. If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the reason before the commands, as in, “The place on which you are standing, it is holy ground, so you must not come close to here. Take your sandals off from on your feet.”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:6

## Exodus 3:6 (#2) (id: 392309)

**"I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"**

This a direct quotation. The UST continues the quotation from verse 5 rather than including an additional “he said.” This may be more natural in some languages. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate the direct quotation with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

**"your father"**

This could mean (1\) “your father,” if it means “your father,” then it refers to Moses’ own father (2\) “your ancestor,” if it means “your ancestor,” then the phrases following it clarify who “your father” refers to: it refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In most cases, it will be best to translate it as “your father,” i.e. Amram, Moses’ father.

**"And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid from staring toward God"**

Reason: **for he was afraid from staring toward God** Result: **And Moses hid his face** If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

**"And Yahweh said"**

After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues through the end of [3:10](https://ref.ly/Exod3:10).

## Exodus 3:7 (#2) (id: 392313)

**"I have certainly seen"**

The Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Here, “see” is repeated in Hebrew. This expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having **seen** how his people were suffering. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language.

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Exodus 3:7 (#3) (id: 392314)

**"the affliction of my people"**

There are two possessives here: (1\) “affliction of … people”: This is an event\-related possessive where the people are the objects of affliction. They are treated badly as slaves. (2\) “my people”: This one is more difficult as it involves both ownership and the possessive of social relationship. God views his people as his possession, and he is also in relationship with them as their God because they are descended from Abraham, though at this time they may not know God as theirs.

## Exodus 3:21 (#1) (id: 392393)

**"favor in the eyes of the Egyptians"**

**In the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites (Hebrews) leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them (because they want them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgment). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning.

* **Associated Articles:** Double Negatives (ID: 33265)

## Exodus 3:21 (#7) (id: 392399)

**"you will not go emptily"**

Here Yahweh uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

## Exodus 3:22 (#1) (id: 392400)

**"and from one sojourning in her house"**

The word, **sojourning** means living somewhere other than one’s native land, usually temporarily. It is unclear both who the sojourning (visiting) women are and in whose house they are sojourning, leaving several possibilities. Most translations which make a decision about who they are identify both the temporary resident and her host home as Egyptian. This makes sense as the Israelites will be plundering the Egyptians. If it is possible to leave this ambiguous in your translation, that would be best.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 3:22

## Exodus 3:22 (#2) (id: 392401)

**"And you will put them on your sons and on your daughters, and you will plunder"**

## Exodus - Chapter 4 Introduction (id: 718576)

Exodus 4 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–17: Moses hesitates to obey so Yahweh gives Moses signs to prove his commission
* v. 18–28: Moses goes back to Egypt
* v. 29–31: Moses and Aaron meet with the Israelite leaders and tell them what Yahweh said

Potential Translation Issues
----------------------------

### Quotations

* There is a difficult transition between [4:4](https://ref.ly/Exod4:4) and [4:5](https://ref.ly/Exod4:5) because the quotation stops in the middle to inject a bit of narrative. When it resumes in [4:5](https://ref.ly/Exod4:5), the sentence seems incomplete (even if merged directly with the quotation fragment in [4:4](https://ref.ly/Exod4:4)). (See: Ellipsis)\* Yahweh’s instructions to Moses are complex, and there are up to four levels of quotations in this chapter. Translators will need to decide if some of these need to become indirect quotations (if that is possible in their language) and take great care to use the proper quotation markings in the proper locations.

### Order of events

* The order of events is not always clear. In [4:14](https://ref.ly/Exod4:14) Yahweh tells Moses that Aaron is coming to meet him, but Yahweh telling Aaron to go meet Moses in the wilderness is not recorded until [4:27](https://ref.ly/Exod4:27).
* The timing of the events in [4:18](https://ref.ly/Exod4:18)\\\-[4:27](https://ref.ly/Exod4:27), especially verses 18–19 and 27 in relation to the rest of the events of the chapter, is unclear.

### Thus says Yahweh

The first of over 400 occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh occurs in [4:22](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22). It occurs ten times in the book of Exodus; nine of these are between chapters 4–11\. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your leader that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the leader, that would be a good phrase to consider.

### Yahweh’s attempt to kill someone

The encounter recorded from [4:24](https://ref.ly/Exod4:24) to [4:26](https://ref.ly/Exod4:26) is one of the strangest and most difficult passages in the entire book. Difficulties include:

* To whom do the pronouns refer? Masculine pronouns are used throughout the section, but there are two possible antecedents, Moses (who is not named in the narrative) and Zipporah’s son (who was presumably also Moses’ son, but this is how he is referred to in this text. For why, see below on why Yahweh did this). Most commentators believe the pronouns refer to Moses.
* Circumcision is described in fairly graphic detail. Different cultures will need to approach this differently. Some may have terms for circumcision, while others may be comfortable translating mostly literally, and others will need to use euphemisms or other strategies to translate. (See: Circumcise)
* The meaning of the phrase **a bridegroom of blood** (ULT) is unknown.
* Why did Yahweh attack Moses? Many commentators conclude that Moses had neglected to circumcise one of his sons because it displeased Zipporah, and Yahweh was holding Moses responsible before he returned to lead the Israelites (who should have been circumcised). When Zipporah repented by circumcising the son herself and touching the foreskin to Moses’ feet, Yahweh relents. These conclusions should help inform translation but should not be made explicit in the text.

Study Concepts in this Chapter
------------------------------

### Children of God

This chapter introduces the concept that Israel, the people group, is the chosen people of God and God’s firstborn son. (See: Elect and People of God and First Born)

### Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart

Scholars are divided over how to understand this statement. There is debate over how Pharaoh has an active or passive role in the hardening of his own heart. Translators should simply follow the text. In Exodus 4–14 there are ten statements that Yahweh hardens Pharaoh’s heart, and ten statements that Pharaoh hardens his own heart. (See: Active or Passive)

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:1
* **Associated Articles:** Circumcise (ID: 26450); Elect (ID: 26553); First Born (ID: 26600); People of God (ID: 26942); Active or Passive (ID: 33258); Ellipsis (ID: 33267)

## Exodus 4:1 (#1) (id: 392403)

**"And Moses answered and said"**

Here, **answered and said** is a Hebrew expression which does not convey any extra information. Unless your language naturally uses a similar structure, it is better to translate one verb and omit the other. Alternate translation: “Moses answered”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:1

## Exodus 4:1 (#2) (id: 392404)

**"But look, they will not believe me, and they will not listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘Yahweh has not appeared to you"**

This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

This is a second\-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you could translate it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh has not appeared to me”

## Exodus 4:1 (#5) (id: 392407)

**"But look"**

This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “Listen to me.”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 4:4

## Exodus 4:4 (#2) (id: 392411)

**"Reach out your hand and take it by its tail"**

This direct quotation is interrupted by Moses obeying Yahweh. This is probably a tightly ordered sequence of events where Yahweh paused and then continued speaking immediately after Moses obeyed. The quote resumes in [4:5](https://ref.ly/Exod4:5), and there is more discussion there about how to translate the quotation resumption.

## Exodus 4:5 (#1) (id: 392413)

**"in order to cause them to believe that Yahweh appeared to you, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"**

This continues the direct quotation from the first part of [4:4](https://ref.ly/Exod4:4). It may be more natural to reorganize verses four and five to keep the quote together. If you rearrange like this, Moses picking up the snake/staff should come after the full quotation. However, it is better to do something similar to the UST, which restates that Yahweh is speaking and provides some implied directives from Yahweh to make a complete sentence.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, am the one who does this!”

The timing and situation for Yahweh speaking to Moses here is not specified. Some conjecture that it was part of the narrative of the encounter with Yahweh from the previous verses but placed after his request to Jethro for an unknown reason. Another speculation is that Moses delayed returning to Egypt (either by his own choice, Yahweh’s instructions, or someone else delaying him) and Yahweh came and told him again (the UST explicitly offers this optional translation).

**"and he returned toward the land of Egypt"**

After the incident on the road in verses [24–26](https://ref.ly/Exod4:24-Exod4:26). Moses’ family is not mentioned again until [18:2](https://ref.ly/Exod18:2), which says that Moses sent them back, so it may be better to make a translation similar to the UST, which only commits to the family starting on the way to Egypt. This option has the further benefit of allowing for the several events that happen before Moses gets to Egypt. The ULT’s **toward** is another way of giving space in the translation for the next several events.

**"the staff of God"**

The phrase **the staff of God** refers to the staff that God told Moses to take with him in [4:17](https://ref.ly/Exod4:17). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly.

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

## Exodus 4:20 (#5) (id: 392469)

**"the staff of God"**

The book describes this staff as **the staff of God** because God appointed it as his instrument so that Moses could do miraculous works through it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Make sure your translation does not lead people to think the staff was a magic wand or shaman’s staff that had its own power or power from Moses or that the staff gave Moses the ability to command God. In every instance where miracles happened, first God told Moses to do something with the staff, then Moses obeyed, and then God caused a miracle. Alternate translation: “the staff that God had told him to bring because God intended to work powerfully through it when Moses stretched it out.”

**"all the miracles that I put in your hand"**

Here the miracles are spoken of as if they were items Moses could carry. In part, this may be because the three signs already given to Moses involved the use of his hand.

**"Thus says Yahweh"**

This is the first of hundreds of occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase, **Thus says Yahweh**, used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your rulers that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the rulers, that would be a good phrase to consider.

**"Israel is"**

The word **Israel** here represents all the people of Israel as a group. It is important to keep the singular reference to Israel as son rather than change it to something like ‘the Israelites are my children,’ because God is making a particular contrast here between his son and Pharaoh’s son.

**"from him"**

As in [4:24](https://ref.ly/Exod4:24), **him** could refer to either Moses or the son, but most commentators think it is still Moses. The UST uses “anyone” to preserve ambiguity. Alternative translation: “from Moses”

## Exodus 4:26 (#4) (id: 392502)

**"bridegroom of blood"**

This is a unique quotation because Zipporah probably does not speak again; rather, the quotation refers back to her statement in [4:25](https://ref.ly/Exod4:25). Use a form from your language for quoting a portion of what someone previously said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as an indirect quotation.

**"bridegroom of blood” because of the circumcision"**

It is not clear if the quotation includes **because of the circumcision** or if that is a comment explaining the quotation.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:1

## Exodus 5:1 (#1) (id: 392517)

## Exodus 5:1 (#5) (id: 392521)

**"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Let my people go, and they shall celebrate me in the wilderness"**

This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. There is a second\-level quotation fully contained within this portion which is addressed elsewhere. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

## Exodus 5:2 (#1) (id: 392524)

**"And"** \- **"said"**

The result here is exactly as God has said; therefore, a contrastive transition word is reasonable but not required, given the immediate human context.

See: Connect — Contrast Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:2
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Contrast Relationship (ID: 33329)

## Exodus 5:2 (#2) (id: 392525)

**"Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go"**

This is not a rhetorical question, though Pharaoh may have spoken with contempt. Pharaoh would have considered himself a god. The Egyptians had several gods, and most people groups were assumed to have their own gods. Therefore, Pharaoh had truly not heard of Yahweh (who has just revealed his name to Moses).

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:2

## Exodus 5:2 (#3) (id: 392526)

**"Israel"** \- **"Israel"**

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:2

## Exodus 5:3 (#1) (id: 392529)

**"And they said"**

It may not make sense in all languages for multiple people to speak. Since Aaron was appointed as Moses’ spokesman, consider the alternative translation: “Aaron replied”

**"with us."** \- **"let us go"** \- **"and let us sacrifice"** \- **"he come upon us"**

## Exodus 5:4 (#1) (id: 392533)

**"Moses and Aaron, why are you causing the people to leave off from their tasks"**

Pharaoh uses this rhetorical question to express his anger toward Moses and Aaron for taking the Israelites away from their work. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Stop distracting the people from doing their work!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: 33310)

## Exodus 5:4 (#2) (id: 392534)

**"Go to your burdens"**

This **your** could refer to Moses and Aaron, or it could mean “all you Israelite people.” The second meaning is more likely. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here.

## Exodus 5:5 (#1) (id: 392535)

**"And Pharaoh said"**

It is unusual for the same speaker to be reintroduced like this. Some translations omit the repetition, but there is another option. This statement may be more connected to the next couple of verses, so it might be appropriate to make a minor break before this verse.

## Exodus 5:5 (#2) (id: 392536)

**"And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you have caused them to rest from their burdens"**

This statement by Pharaoh may have been him commenting to himself, or he may have only thought this statement silently; either way, it led to his next actions. If this would be confusing in your language, consider stating it in a way that clarifies that his statement or thoughts here impacted his next actions.

**"And"** \- **"Pharaoh ordered the taskmasters among the people and officers, saying"**

Pharaoh may have sent a messenger or messengers to the taskmasters and officers or spoken to one or a few representatives of them at his court rather than speaking to them directly. Alternative translation: “And … Pharaoh gave an order to the taskmasters among the people and officers. He said,”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:6

## Exodus 5:6 (#2) (id: 392540)

**"the taskmasters"**

**Taskmasters** were Egyptians whose job it was to force the Israelites to do hard work. These are probably the same as the “overseers” of labor gangs from [Exodus 1:11](https://ref.ly/Exod1:11), but here the term is harsher. Alternative translation: “oppressors”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:6

## Exodus 5:6 (#3) (id: 392541)

**"and officers"**

**Officers** were probably Israelite slaves who were in charge of the other Israelites but who answered to the Egyptian taskmasters.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 5:6

## Exodus 5:6 (#4) (id: 392542)

**"I am not giving straw to you"**

The structure of this phrase and the one that opens [5:11](https://ref.ly/Exod5:11) create a strong contrast between what **I** (Pharaoh) and **you** (you all, the Israelites) will do.

**"I am not giving straw to you"**

Pharaoh uses **I** to refer to his ownership and commands. Pharaoh does not physically give the Israelites straw. Rather, he had commanded his servants to take straw that belonged to Pharaoh and give it to the Israelites. Now he told his servants to stop providing straw.

**"You go and get your own straw from wherever you might find it"**

The structure of this phrase serves as the opposing side of the contrast Pharaoh sets up in the last phrase. By explicitly using a pronoun with a command, he is emphasizing who will go get straw.

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And the taskmasters beat the officers of the sons of Israel”

The taskmasters used this question to show they were angry with the lack of bricks. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

## Exodus - Chapter 6 Introduction (id: 718578)

Exodus 6 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–13, 28–30: Yahweh repeats his commissioning of Moses after the bad events recorded in chapter 5
* v. 14–27: Genealogy of Moses and Aaron

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

### Repetition of events:

Most of the content of this chapter is very similar to the events and dialogue in chapters 3–4\. For consistency, translators should consult the decisions they made there while keeping in mind that this narrative is not exactly the same. Also, verses 10–12 and verses 28–30 are very similar to each other. These events are probably a recommissioning of Moses. After his first encounter with Pharaoh went very poorly and the Israelites seem to reject God, Yahweh reminds Moses of his promises and power.

### Referring to God

A name for God (**Yahweh**) and a title for God (**El Shaddai**) are mentioned in this chapter ([6:2](https://ref.ly/Exod6:2)\\\-[6:3](https://ref.ly/Exod6:3)). The precise meaning of El Shaddai is not known, but most scholars think it means something like “almighty.” Translators who have worked on Genesis may find confusing the statement that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know Yahweh as the name of God.

### Other possible translation difficulties:

With little explanation, a large portion of the chapter is devoted to the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Some of the people in the genealogy lived much longer than is normal for humans today. If translators are not familiar with the lengths of people’s lives in the early days of the world (as recorded in Genesis, especially chapter 5\), this may cause confusion.

Study Concepts in this Chapter
------------------------------

### Promised Land

According to the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham, Egypt is not the home of the Hebrew people. Their home is the Promised Land in Canaan. The people are to return home to their land. (See: Covenant and Promised Land)

### God and his people

In verse 7, note the mention of a very important biblical theme of God being “your God” and the special relationship that his people have with him.

## Exodus 6:1 (#1) (id: 392600)

**"Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand he will let them go; and by a strong hand he will drive them out of his land"**

This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

## Exodus 6:1 (#3) (id: 392602)

**"by a strong hand"** \- **"and by a strong hand"**

Here, **hand** is a metonym for power. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “by a strong power … and by a strong power”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Exodus 6:1 (#4) (id: 392603)

**"by a strong hand"** \- **"and by a strong hand"**

It is not clear in the text whose **hand** is referred to here. The options include: (1\) Both refer to God’s hand (forcing Pharaoh’s actions) (2\) Both refer to Pharaoh’s hand (forcing the Israelites out) (3\) They don’t refer to the same person’s hand; the first refers to God’s and the second to Pharaoh’s. The UST has followed (1\), which is the most common interpretation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: (1\) “by my strong hand … and by my strong hand” (2\) “by his strong hand … and by his strong hand” (3\) “by my strong hand … and by his strong hand”

## Exodus 6:1 (#5) (id: 392604)

**"for by a strong hand he will let them go; and by a strong hand he will drive them out of his land"**

These two phrases mean similar things. God says the same thing twice, in similar ways, for emphasis. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let my people leave the land” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase intensifies the first by portraying Pharaoh as not merely letting the Israelites go, but as forcing them to leave the land. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let them go, in fact, I will force him to force them to leave his land”

## Exodus 6:2 (#1) (id: 392606)

**"And God spoke to Moses, and said to him"**

There is a transition here. Before this verse, Yahweh was answering Moses’ question more directly. At the beginning of this verse, Yahweh is reintroduced as “God” because he begins to make a clarifying statement about himself and his relationship with the Israelites and their ancestors as well as his plans for the Israelites. Much of this section repeats what Yahweh has already told Moses. You may want to consider a section break before this verse.

**"as El Shaddai"**

**El Shaddai** is a title for God that many scholars think means “almighty.” You will need to decide if you will transliterate the term into your language or translate the meaning. Either approach has broad support. Alternative translation: “as the strongest God of all”

**"but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them"**

This statement is very difficult to understand as God’s name, Yahweh, is used throughout Genesis, including by Abraham and others. There are many theories about what it means; the view followed by the UST is that now God is revealing to the Israelites a fuller meaning of his divine name than what Abraham and others knew. Alternate translation: “but my name Yahweh was not understood by them”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:3

## Exodus 6:4 (#1) (id: 392610)

**"Therefore"**

God is now telling Moses to deliver a message to the Israelites of what God is going to do because of everything that he said in verses 2–5\.

## Exodus 6:9 (#2) (id: 392626)

**"because of shortness of spirit"**

Here, the people’s **spirit** is spoken of as something that could be measured. By calling it “short,” the author is saying they did not have very much motivation or hope. Alternate translation: “because they had no hope”

## Exodus 6:11 (#1) (id: 392628)

**"that he should let the sons of Israel go from his land"**

This statement tells Moses what to discuss with Pharaoh. Some languages may need to covey this information as a direct quotation. Be careful to change the third\-person pronouns to second\-person pronouns if you do this. Alternate translation: “and say, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’”

**"before the face of Yahweh"**

Here, **face** represents the presence of a person. There may also be a hint of impudence in Moses’ attitude that is conveyed by the words **before the face of Yahweh**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in the presence of Yahweh” or “boldly to Yahweh”

## Exodus 6:12 (#2) (id: 392630)

**"Behold"**

**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 6:12

## Exodus 6:12 (#3) (id: 392631)

**"Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me, so how will Pharaoh listen to me"**

Moses asked this question in hopes that God would change his mind about using Moses. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Since the Israelites did not listen to me, neither will Pharaoh!”

## Exodus 6:12 (#5) (id: 392633)

**"And I have uncircumcised lips"**

This is a metaphor that means that Moses was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude; your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And I do not speak well”

## Exodus 6:13 (#1) (id: 392634)

**"and he gave them a command to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh"**

This phrase is somewhat difficult to translate. Here, **command** could also be translated as “charge” or “commission.” Another difficulty is knowing to whom the command is directed: is it to Moses and Aaron or are they to give the command to Pharaoh and the Israelites; thus **to** could be translated as “for” or “regarding.” Alternate translations: “and he charged them regarding the sons of Israel and regarding Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a command for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a commission to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh”

## Exodus - Chapter 7 Introduction (id: 718579)

Exodus 7 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–9: The end of Yahweh’s re\-sending of Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh
* v. 10–13: Pharaoh’s first refusal, the sign of the snakes
* v. 14–25: First plague: the Nile turns to blood

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Miracles

When Yahweh had Moses perform miracles, Pharaoh’s men were able to copy these miracles. It is unknown how they were able to do this, but since it was not from Yahweh, they were probably done under some evil power. (See: Miracle and Evil)

### Pharaoh’s hard heart

Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard, strong, or heavy in this chapter. This means that he was not willing to obey Yahweh’s instructions.

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter Include:
----------------------------------------------------------

* Moses as God to Pharaoh
* A number of difficult terms: prophet, signs, wonders, miracles, sorcerers, magicians, magic, judgments, canals, reservoirs
* The use of “heart” to refer to the seat of will and emotion
* Up to third\-level quotations

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Evil (ID: 26576); Miracle (ID: 26880)

## Exodus 7:1 (#1) (id: 392664)

**"Moses"**

After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of [7:5](https://ref.ly/Exod7:5). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:1

## Exodus 7:1 (#3) (id: 392666)

**"I have made you God to Pharaoh"**

This means Moses would represent the same authority to Pharaoh as God did to Moses. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](https://ref.ly/Exod4:16). Alternate translation: “I will cause Pharaoh to consider you as a god”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Exodus 7:1 (#4) (id: 392667)

**"and your brother Aaron will be your prophet"**

This phrase compares Aaron to a prophet, because Aaron will actually be the one who proclaims to Pharaoh what Moses tells him. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](https://ref.ly/Exod4:16). Alternate translation: “and Aaron your brother will act like your prophet”

* **Associated Articles:** Kinship (ID: 33385)

## Exodus 7:2 (#2) (id: 392669)

**"that he should let the sons of Israel go from his land"**

Some languages may need to make this a direct quotation. If so, be sure to mark it as a second\-level quotation, subordinate to Yahweh’s main speech. See what you did in [6:25](https://ref.ly/Exod6:25). Alternative translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’”

Alternate translation: “from Egypt”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:2

## Exodus 7:3 (#1) (id: 392671)

**"will harden the heart of Pharaoh"**

This means God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **hard**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs. **hard** here. Alternate translation: “will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Exodus 7:3 (#2) (id: 392672)

**"my signs and my miracles"**

The words **signs** and **wonders** mean basically the same thing. God uses them to emphasize the greatness of what he will do in Egypt. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine them.

## Exodus 7:4 (#1) (id: 392673)

**"to you"**

Here, **you** means Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here.

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Exodus 7:4 (#4) (id: 392676)

**"my armies, my people, the sons of Israel"**

These phrases refer to the Israelites in three different ways; they do not refer to three different groups of people. Here, **armies** is the same word translated “hosts” in [Exodus 6:26](https://ref.ly/Exod6:26). Alternate translation: “the armies of my Israelite people”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:4

## Exodus 7:5 (#1) (id: 392677)

**"And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh"**

This is the result of God rescuing the Israelites. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

## Exodus 7:7 (#3) (id: 392683)

**"was a son of 80 years"** \- **"was a son of 83 years"**

The phrase **a son of**, followed by a number and then **years**, is an idiom that refers to their age. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

## Exodus 7:8 (#1) (id: 392684)

**"And Yahweh said"**

This verse marks the beginning of new sections, both major and minor. The major story of the plagues and Exodus itself unfolds from here until after Pharaoh’s army is defeated at the Red Sea. The next minor event is the miracle of the rods becoming snakes. Either by using particular forms that your language uses to mark transitions or by making a section break and heading, this transition should be marked for readers.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:8
* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Exodus 7:8 (#2) (id: 392685)

**"saying"**

Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:8

## Exodus 7:9 (#1) (id: 392686)

**"For Pharaoh will speak to you, saying, ‘Create a miracle yourself,’ and you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before the face of Pharaoh; let it become a serpent"**

The two quotations in this verse could be stated as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “When Pharaoh tells you to do a miracle, then you will tell Aaron to take his staff and throw it down before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake”

## Exodus 7:9 (#2) (id: 392687)

**"Take your staff and throw it down before the face of Pharaoh; let it become a serpent"**

This is a second\-level direct quotation. The second level may either end after **Pharaoh** or at the end of the verse. If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 7:9

## Exodus 7:9 (#4) (id: 392689)

**"to you,"** \- **"yourself"**

These pronouns are plural, referring to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here.

## Exodus 7:9 (#5) (id: 392690)

**"before the face of Pharaoh"**

Although **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses and Aaron are to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so that Pharaoh can see them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language.

**"before the face of Pharaoh and before the faces of his servants"**

This time, while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Aaron actually does this right in front of Pharaoh and his servants so they could watch what happens. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “where Pharaoh and his servants could see it”

**"the staff of"** \- **"their staffs"**

It may be necessary in some languages to translate the word **staff** as “snake,” since it had turned into one. This may be true if it would not make sense in the target language to say (because it is not living) that a staff swallowed or ate something. It may also may not make sense in some languages to speak of the snakes as staffs once they have been transformed.

**"And the heart of Pharaoh was strong"**

Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21), but note that this is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn, as many others in this part of the narrative do).

* v. 16–19: Third plague (first that magicians cannot imitate): gnats
* v. 20–32: Fourth plague: flies

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

* the exact insects in plagues 3–4 are not certain; translation teams will need to decide what insects they can use for each
* Pharaoh makes his own heart heavy, that is, he determines to be proud and resist Yahweh twice in this chapter
* the Israelites’ sacrifices are spoken of as an abomination to the Egyptians, but it is not specified how or why that is

### Lifting up the hand and staff:

In the next few chapters, God will instruct Moses or Aaron or both to raise his hand or staff or both hand and staff. The narrative will then record who will raise his hand or staff or both. The instruction and the action do not always match exactly. God may say raise your hand, and the narrative may say that Moses raised his staff. These are not conflicting reports. Translators should understand that the hand and the staff are always understood together. They are one unit, and they can both be mentioned, or they can be mentioned separately. In each case, Moses or Aaron raises his hand with the staff in it. This fact is merely expressed differently.

The same term is used in Genesis 43:32 and 46:34 to describe the Egyptians’ feelings about eating with Hebrews and about the Hebrew profession of shepherding, respectively.

## Exodus 9:1 (#2) (id: 392831)

**"to Moses"**

After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of [9:4](https://ref.ly/Exod9:4) and contains two additional levels of quotes. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

**"on your livestock"**

While the word **your** here is not plural, the next verse shows that it refers to all the people of Egypt who owned cattle. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, you may want to use a plural form here.

## Exodus 9:3 (#5) (id: 392840)

**"on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the cattle, and on the flock"**

This long list is meant to reinforce the universal effects of the coming plague.

* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: 33324)

## Exodus 9:3 (#7) (id: 392842)

**"heavy"**

Here the plague is spoken of as if it weighed a lot. This means it would be very bad.

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Exodus 9:6 (#2) (id: 392853)

Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do).

**"You are still exalting yourself against my people"**

Pharaoh’s opposition to letting the Israelites go to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if he were raising himself up as a barrier to them. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are still blocking my people”

**"You are"** \- **"exalting yourself"**

Here, Pharaoh is both the subject and object of the sentence. Translate this in a way that conveys that (1\) Pharaoh is making Pharaoh (himself) proud and (2\) this is metaphorically expressed as Pharaoh making Pharaoh (himself) the obstacle in the Israelites’ way to freedom (as discussed in the previous note.)

See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](https://ref.ly/Exod7:13).

This is similar to [9:12](https://ref.ly/Exod9:12). In this case, what Yahweh said is spoken of as if it were something that could be held in someone’s hand. This means that Moses delivered a message from Yahweh that Pharaoh would be stubborn. It is not clear if this message was given to the Israelites or if this refers to Moses’ statement to Pharaoh in [9:30](https://ref.ly/Exod9:30). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

* v. 16–20: Pharaoh seems to repent, but it does not last
* v. 21–29: Ninth plague: darkness

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:1

## Exodus 10:1 (#1) (id: 392936)

**"for I have made his heart and the heart of his servants heavy"**

This means God made Pharaoh and his servants stubborn. Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their **hearts** were **heavy.** If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21), but note that the metaphor is slightly different here.

**"and said to him"**

After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues until near the end of [10:6](https://ref.ly/Exod10:6). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

**"And it will cover"** \- **"And it will devour"** \- **"And it will devour"**

Here the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust” in the previous verse. Insects are often referred to without gender in English, but you will need to use whatever number, gender, or noun class is required in your language to agree with the word for “locust” that you used in [10:4](https://ref.ly/Exod10:4).

**"from the day they came to be on the earth until this day"**

Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to show Pharaoh that he is stubbornly causing the destruction of Egypt.

**"May Yahweh be with you in the same way as I will let you and your children go"**

**May Yahweh be with you** is usually a blessing but is almost certainly not a blessing here. It likely means something like “It will take Yahweh’s power to make me let you and your children go,” or “May Yahweh be as favorable to you as I am to the idea of letting your children go.” Pharaoh is saying that it will take Yahweh to make him do what Moses wants, but he does not think that will happen.

## Exodus 10:10 (#2) (id: 392957)

**"See, for evil is before your faces"**

The phrase **for evil is before your faces** could either be a warning from Pharaoh that Moses’ actions will lead to evil for the Israelites, or it could mean that Pharaoh thinks the Israelites plan something that he considers evil. **Faces** is a metonym for the whole person.

**"just this once,"** \- **"only"**

Pharaoh could either be desperate and using **just this once … only** to attempt to make his request as small as possible to increase the chances of it being granted, or he could be still too proud to admit guilt beyond this single incident (which is probably his bold statement about Yahweh being with the Israelites in [10:10](https://ref.ly/Exod10:10)). The former seems more likely given that he terms this plague “this death.” If your culture has a way of making a request seem as small as possible, you may want to use it to translate Pharaoh’s request.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 10:21

## Exodus 10:21 (#3) (id: 392985)

**"Egypt, and darkness will feel"**

This is a somewhat puzzling construction which describes the darkness. Most English translations take it as a passive, which restated actively means, “people will feel the darkness,” meaning metaphorically what is expressed in different ways in the UST and the alternate translation here. Another option is to view the Hebrew verb form as causative and translate as such: “and the darkness will cause people to feel,” meaning people will have to feel where they are going because they will not be able to see. A final option would be a personification of darkness such that the darkness gropes around, filling in every place in the land. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Egypt, an extremely oppressive darkness”

## Exodus 10:25 (#1) (id: 392992)

**"Also you, you must give in our hands sacrifices and burnt offerings"**

The construction here is difficult. Based on context, Moses is probably not saying that Pharaoh needs to provide his own animals to the Israelites. He is asking Pharaoh to let the Israelites take their own animals with them. **Give in our hands** means to take with them, by whatever means, which may include holding a rope in the hand to lead the animals or any other means of herding the animals.

## Exodus - Chapter 11 Introduction (id: 718583)

Exodus 11 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

Chapter 11 is a transition point in the book. The previous nine plagues (in their three sequences of three) have come to an end and the last plague, the death of the firstborn, is about to occur, along with the Passover and the Exodus itself. It is difficult to know if the events in chapter 11 all are recorded in the order in which they happened. For translation, you should follow the order of the text if it will not confuse your readers.

It may be helpful to think that after the end of chapter 10, Yahweh spoke to Moses immediately, before he actually left Pharaoh’s presence (v. [1](https://ref.ly/Exod11:1)\-[2](https://ref.ly/Exod11:2)). [11:3](https://ref.ly/Exod11:3) is a comment suggesting that the Egyptians will be willing to do as the Israelites are told to ask them to do in [2](https://ref.ly/Exod11:2). In verses [4](https://ref.ly/Exod11:4)\-[7](https://ref.ly/Exod11:7) Moses gives Pharaoh and his officials a message from Yahweh that Yahweh is giving to Moses right at that moment. At the end of [8](https://ref.ly/Exod11:8) Moses leaves Pharaoh’s presence (completing the interaction from the end of ch. [10](https://ref.ly/Exod11:10)). [11:9](https://ref.ly/Exod11:9) may either be Yahweh telling Moses what is going to happen, or it could be part of the summary that occurs in verse [10](https://ref.ly/Exod11:10). Verse 10 summarizes what has happened in chs. 5–10 (especially the plagues in chs. 7–10\) in preparation for the great last plague.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 11:1

## Exodus 11:1 (#1) (id: 393008)

**"to Moses"**

After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues until the end of [11:2](https://ref.ly/Exod11:2). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

## Exodus 11:1 (#2) (id: 393009)

**"As soon as he lets go, he will"** \- **"drive"** \- **"away"**

These verbs (**lets go** and **drive away**) are meant to immediately follow one another. When you translate, make sure they are almost simultaneous in time; the letting go happens and then immediately the driving away happens.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 11:1

## Exodus 11:1 (#4) (id: 393011)

**"you"** \- **"you"**

Each occurrence of the word **you** in this verse is plural and refers to Moses and the rest of the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here.

## Exodus 11:2 (#1) (id: 393012)

**"now"**

Here, **now** conveys urgency, indicating that Moses should speak soon, without delaying for other things. If you have a way of giving a command that shows that it is important for someone to do it quickly, it would be better to translate in that way than in a way that means “now” in a time sense (versus earlier or later).

## Exodus 11:3 (#2) (id: 393017)

**"the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians"**

Here, **in the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings or opinion. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them. (Because the Egyptians have suffered under God’s judgment, the Egyptians want so badly to see them leave). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. See how you translated this in [3:21](https://ref.ly/Exod3:21).

**"from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the mill, and every firstborn of a beast"**

This is a merism. First, two extremes are mentioned: the highest of society (**Pharaoh, who sits on his throne**) and the lowest (**the slave girl who is behind the mill**). Then the animals (**beasts**) are added making it a three\-item list of parts of society and even the economy to show the totality of the coming judgment.

## Exodus - Chapter 12 Introduction (id: 718584)

Exodus 12 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The events of this chapter are known as the Passover. They are remembered in the celebration of Passover. (See: Passover)

1. Instruction v. 1–28

    * v. 1–20: Yahweh gives instructions

    + v. 1–11: how to eat this Passover
                + v. 12–13: description of the plague
                + v. 14–20: directions for future celebration of Passover
        * v. 21–28: Moses repeats Yahweh’s instructions to Israelites
2. Narrative v. 29–42: Passover and Exodus
3. Instruction v. 43–49: which foreigners may eat Passover
4. Summary Narrative v. 50–51

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Unleavened bread

The concept of unleavened bread is introduced in this chapter. Its significance stems from its connection to the events in this chapter. (See: Unleavened Bread)

### Ethnic segregation

The Hebrew people were to be separate from the rest of the world. Because of this, they separated themselves from other people groups. At this time, these foreigners were looked upon as unholy. (See: Holy)

Potential Translation Issues:
-----------------------------

### Passover

### Pronoun usage

In the long quotation (verses 3–20\) that Yahweh tells Moses and Aaron to convey to the Israelites, he speaks of them in the third person (“they must”) in [12:3–4](https://ref.ly/Exod12:3-Exod12:4) and [12:7–8](https://ref.ly/Exod12:7-Exod12:8) and to them in the second person (“you must”) for all the rest of the instruction. Some languages may need to keep the pronoun person consistent throughout the quotation.

### You plural

In this chapter, almost every occurrence of “you” or “your” is plural. Each one refers to all the Israelites. Those that are not will be marked. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form throughout unless otherwise noted. (See: Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural)

## Exodus 12:2 (#1) (id: 393035)

**"This month is to you the head of the months"**

The start of this verse is the beginning of a direct quote which continues until the end of [12:20](https://ref.ly/Exod12:20). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

## Exodus 12:2 (#2) (id: 393036)

**"This month is to you the head of the months. It is the first to you of the months of the year"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the month in which the events of this chapter take place will be the beginning of their calendar year.

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Exodus 12:2 (#3) (id: 393037)

**"It is the first to you of the months of the year"**

The first month of the Hebrew calendar includes the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. It marks when Yahweh rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

See: Hebrew Months

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:2
* **Associated Articles:** Hebrew Months (ID: 33382)

## Exodus 12:3 (#1) (id: 393038)

**"Speak"**

The command here is to both Moses and Aaron. If your language uses a different form if two are people addressed, use a dual form here.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:3
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural (ID: 33319)

## Exodus 12:3 (#2) (id: 393039)

**"they shall take to themselves, each man, a lamb to the house of the fathers: a lamb to a house"**

This seems to be indicating that if multiple families live in one house, the man who is the leader of the family group that lives there should take one lamb for that whole household. Alternate translation: “the father of each household must take a lamb for his household, one per household”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:3

## Exodus 12:3 (#3) (id: 393040)

**"a lamb to a house"**

Alternate translation: “one lamb per house”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:3

## Exodus 12:3 (#4) (id: 393041)

**"a lamb"** \- **"a lamb"**

The word **lamb** literally means “of the flock,” and it could also be translated as a sheep or a goat. Here, the ULT uses **lamb** (a young sheep), because [12:5](https://ref.ly/Exod12:5) specifies that it must be one year old. “Kid” (a young goat) would be equally valid as verse 5 also says that it could be either a sheep or a goat. You may translate it as either sheep or goat, whichever would be most familiar.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:3

## Exodus 12:4 (#1) (id: 393042)

**"And if the household is too few for having a lamb"**

This means that there are not enough people in the family to eat an entire lamb. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If there are not enough people in the household to eat an entire lamb”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Exodus 12:4 (#2) (id: 393043)

**"and his neighbor near to his house by the number of people"**

The phrase **by the number of people** helps to clarify which sort of **neighbor near to his house** the Israelite should choose. They should count their own household and another household and try to have a group that is the right number to eat an entire lamb. Alternate translation: “and his neighbor who lives near him and whose family is the right size to share a lamb with”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:4

## Exodus 12:4 (#3) (id: 393044)

**"each man"**

Here **man** refers to each person, whether man, woman, or child. Alternate translation: “each family member”

**"And this day shall become"**

Verses [14–20](https://ref.ly/Exod12:14-Exod12:20) are instructions for the Israelites’ future celebration of the Passover. If your language makes a distinction between near and far future events or between near and general commands, you may need to make clear that these verses primarily have a later application.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 12:14

## Exodus 12:14 (#2) (id: 393057)

As noted in the previous note, the metaphor **cut off** has at least three possible meanings. By whom that person will be cut off is not specified; it could be the Israelites or Yahweh. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

**"In the first month, on the fourteenth day"**

This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. The fourteenth day is near the beginning of April on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

Here, **you** and **your** are singular but they refer to the whole nation. If the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of “you” in your translation.

## Exodus 12:29 (#1) (id: 393089)

**""**

The next few verses are the climax of this part of Exodus. A number of literary features mark it out. First, it is specially introduced with **and so it happened,** which is used to mark major breaks in the narrative. Second, it uses repetition: **firstborn** is repeated four times in verse 29 so that the reader cannot possibly miss what is happening. **Night** is repeated in verse 29, 30, and 31\. **Got up/get up** is repeated in verse 30 and 31\. In verses 31 and 32 “also” occurs five times (it is translated as “both” once in the ULT). Third, the places of both **Pharaoh** and **the captive** are elaborated on to slow the pace and create a vivid mental image for the reader. In verse 30 there is the listing of sorts of people who got up; note the use of the double negative for emphasis. Your translation should attempt to use the same or similar literary features of your own language that slow down the pace, create vivid imagery, and emphasize that this is a climax point.

## Exodus 12:29 (#2) (id: 393090)

**"from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the house of the pit, and all the firstborn of beasts"**

This phrase indicates that there was no person or household excluded from Yahweh’s judgment. It both speaks of extreme parts of society and then makes this into a list by including the animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on the throne and the firstborn of the captive who was in the house of the pit and the firstborn of everyone in between was struck; even all the firstborn of the beasts were struck”

**"the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians"**

Here, **in the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings or opinion. **Favor** means that those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians saw the Israelites leaving Egypt, they gladly helped them (because they wanted them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgment). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. See how you translated this in [3:21](https://ref.ly/Exod3:21).

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

* There are a number of names of people groups and places in this chapter. However, many have been translated in earlier passages.

## Exodus 13:2 (#1) (id: 393118)

**"Set apart to me all the firstborn, openers of every womb among the sons of Israel, among man and among beast; he is mine"**

This entire verse is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

## Exodus 13:4 (#1) (id: 393122)

**"Aviv"**

This is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. Aviv is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

**"And"** \- **"by fives"**

The meaning of this term (**by fives**) is uncertain. Many English translations opt for something like “prepared for battle,” because this seems to be the meaning in Numbers 32:17 and the related verses in Joshua 1:14 and 4:12\. Because of what the previous verse said about war, it may mean that they went out in formation—like an army would march—but perhaps not armed.

## Exodus - Chapter 14 Introduction (id: 718586)

Exodus 14 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This whole chapter is the record of an important event in the history of Israel known as the “parting of the sea of reeds (Red Sea).” Throughout this chapter and chapter 15, the word “sea” is used. Exodus 13:18 and 15:22 show that this is the sea of reeds (Red Sea). Since the text does not explicitly say that though, the ULT will only say “sea.” In your translation, it may help people to be more specific than the text if just using “sea” is confusing.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Pharaoh’s chariots

These chariots were a fighting force. Pharaoh took an army to kill the Hebrew people. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Rhetorical Questions

The Israelites asked a few rhetorical questions of Moses. These questions were not really directed at Moses, but at Yahweh. This showed their lack of faith in Yahweh. (See: Rhetorical Question and Faith)

## Exodus 14:2 (#1) (id: 393167)

**"Say"**

This verse begins a direct quote which continues into [13:4](https://ref.ly/Exod13:4). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the sons of Israel, ‘Turn and camp before the face of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before the face of Baal Zephon.’”

Furthermore, most translations render **horses of the chariots** as “horses and chariots,” suggesting four total groups (possibly because of [23](https://ref.ly/Exod14:23)).

## Exodus - Chapter 15 Introduction (id: 718587)

Exodus 15 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

Verses 1b\-18 and 21b of chapter 15 are poetry. They are a song of praise to Yahweh because he defeated and destroyed the Egyptian army ([Exodus 14:26–28](https://ref.ly/Exod14:26-Exod14:28)). Translating poetry should be done by someone who is a skilled poet in the target language. Because the forms of poetry are so different in different languages, a translation that is good poetry in the target language may seem very different from the original poem. The structure may look quite different. The poet will be well served by looking at the entire poem from multiple perspectives. He will need to know the meaning of the poem, the themes and discourse structure of the poem, and the feelings that the poem is supposed to create in the reader at each point (UST, tNotes). He will need to understand how that was accomplished by the original form and structure (ULT). Then he will need to compose the translated poem using forms and structures that have the same or similar meaning, themes, discourse elements, and feelings in his own language. Unlike in many other places, most notes in this chapter will not advise towards expressing meaning in plain ways or combining parallel phrases as that advice would be too simplistic for handling poetry.

### Structure

This song follows a basic AB structure which is given to us in verse 1b\-c and 21b\-c:

* A \- praise to Yahweh \- he is magnificent (expressed in various words)
* B \- because he defeats our enemies

The song can be divided into three major sections, each of which is patterned as: AB(a)b. Each section starts with an AB portion which is characterized by fewer verbal forms (especially the A portion). The section then elaborates on each. Note that there are other possible analyses of the structure of the poem.

Here is an outline of the structure according to this model:

* Section 1 (See: alternate breakdown below):
* 1b: A “Let me sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphantly triumphed;”
* 1c: B “the horse and the one riding it he threw into the sea.”
* 2–3: a
* 4–5: b
* Section 2:
* 6a: A
* 6b: B
* 7a: a “And in the abundance of your majesty”
* 7a\-10: b “you overthrow those who rise up against you … ”
* Section 3:
* 11: A
* 12: B
* 13a: a (possibly) “In your covenant loyalty”
* 13a\-17: b
* 18: finale

Alternate breakdown of section 1: it is possible to view 1b\-c as the introduction and divide verse 2 such that:

* 2a: A “Yah is my strength and my song”
* 2b: B “and he has become my salvation”
* 2c\-3: a
* 4–5: b

### Themes:

There are several images and themes that are throughout the song as well as some that are throughout an individual section.

* “High” versus “low”: Yahweh is high, while his enemies are low.
* The following words are all related to the idea of being high or rising up: **triumph** ([1](https://ref.ly/Exod15:1)), **exalt** ([2](https://ref.ly/Exod15:2)), **majestic** ([6](https://ref.ly/Exod15:6), [11](https://ref.ly/Exod15:11)), **majesty** ([7](https://ref.ly/Exod15:7)), and **the mountain of** Yahweh’s **possession** ([17](https://ref.ly/Exod15:17)). In the last case, Yahweh’s people are brought to a high place with him.
* In contrast, his enemies are low. Note in [15:7](https://ref.ly/Exod15:7), Yahweh overthrows those who **rise up against** him. Ideas of being low are as follows: **sank** ([4](https://ref.ly/Exod15:4), [10](https://ref.ly/Exod15:10)), **deeps** ([5](https://ref.ly/Exod15:5)), **descended into the depths** ([5](https://ref.ly/Exod15:5)), **melted away** ([15](https://ref.ly/Exod15:15)), and **fall on them** ([16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16)).
* The strength of Yahweh in [15:2](https://ref.ly/Exod15:2), [15:6](https://ref.ly/Exod15:6), and [15:13](https://ref.ly/Exod15:13).
* The effectiveness of Yahweh’s hand versus the enemy’s hand. Yahweh’s hand (and arm) is effective in [15:6](https://ref.ly/Exod15:6), [15:12](https://ref.ly/Exod15:12), [15:16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16), and [15:17](https://ref.ly/Exod15:17) but the enemy’s hand is ineffective despite his boasting in [15:9](https://ref.ly/Exod15:9).
* There is parallel imagery near the end of each section. The enemy is compared three times by simile to a heavy, inert object. In [15:5](https://ref.ly/Exod15:5) and [15:16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16) that is a **stone**, in [15:10](https://ref.ly/Exod15:10) that is **lead**.
* More parallel imagery occurs at the end of sections one ([5](https://ref.ly/Exod15:5)) and two ([10](https://ref.ly/Exod15:10)): that of the enemy sinking in the water and being covered by it.
* In sections two and three the water ([8](https://ref.ly/Exod15:8)) and the other peoples ([16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16)) are made still by Yahweh.
* Section two begins and ends with **majestic** ([6](https://ref.ly/Exod15:6), [10](https://ref.ly/Exod15:10)) and that word is picked up in the beginning of section three ([11](https://ref.ly/Exod15:11)).
* In section two ([9](https://ref.ly/Exod15:9)), the enemies seek to **dispossess** (or disinherit) the Israelites; in section three ([16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16)), the Israelites come to live in the land of Yahweh’s **possession** (or inheritance).
* In [15:11](https://ref.ly/Exod15:11), three themes for the third section are introduced. These are each expanded on in that section.
* **Holiness** occurs again in [15:13](https://ref.ly/Exod15:13) and [15:16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16)
* **Fear** is vividly described in [15:14–16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:14-Exod15:16) (shake, terror, panic, trembling, melted away, dread)
* Yahweh **does miracles** to protect and build a home for his people
* [15:14–16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:14-Exod15:16) are a chiasm, a complex parallel structure where concepts are repeated in reverse order:
* A: 14a: peoples (nations) *become* afraid
* B: 14b: *inhabitants* of Philistia are afraid
* C: 15a: *rulers* of Edom are afraid
* C’: 15b: *rulers* of Moab are afraid
* B’: 15c: *inhabitants* of Canaan are afraid
* A’: 16a: people *become* afraid
* In section three, there is another parallel structure:
* [13](https://ref.ly/Exod15:13): you led this people \=\> [16](https://ref.ly/Exod15:16): your people pass by
* v13: this people you redeemed \=\> v16: this people you acquired (or purchased or ransomed)
* v13: you led them to the home \=\> [17](https://ref.ly/Exod15:17): you will bring them … to the place … you made
* v13: of your holiness \=\> v17: the Holy Place

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### The Israelite’s discontent

In [15:24](https://ref.ly/Exod15:24) the word **murmur** is introduced for the first time. This is a very strong term for “grumble” or “complain” that is used to describe the Israelites’ attitude throughout their time in the wilderness. It occurs several times in Exodus and Numbers.

### Yahweh’s laws

In verses [24–26](https://ref.ly/Exod15:24-Exod15:26), there is an introductory revelation of the requirement that Israel keep the covenant by obeying the law of Moses. (See: Law of Moses and reveal)

## Exodus 15:9 (#2) (id: 393266)

**"my hand will dispossess them"**

The meaning of this phrase is unclear. The word translated **dispossess** could also mean “possess” or “inherit.” What seems clear is that the Egyptians plan to use their power to prevent the Israelites from possessing good things. Whether this is a reference back to **plunder** earlier in the verse or to recapturing them as slaves or to taking over the Israelites’ place in the land of Goshen or to keeping them from reaching the promised land (of Yahweh’s possession, see [15:17](https://ref.ly/Exod15:17) regarding where Yahweh will bring his people) or something else is not so clear. It could also refer to taking away their life and breath. **Dispossess** was chosen rather than another term because the verb is in a causative form here.

## Exodus - Chapter 16 Introduction (id: 718588)

Exodus 16 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This entire chapter is the story of the Israelites complaining about food and Yahweh providing food. Verses 22–30 introduce the Sabbath.

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Complaints

After complaining about the water, the Israelites complained that they had less food than in Egypt. This is intended to show their ungratefulness and their sinful view of Yahweh. (See: Sin)

### Prohibition against storing food

The people were not allowed to store the food, called manna, that Yahweh provided to them. This is because they were to trust in Yahweh to provide for their needs every day. (See: Trust)

### Sabbath

This is the first recorded celebration of the Sabbath rest. (See: Sabbath)

Possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------

### Bread as food

Yahweh speaks of the food that he will send as if it were bread. The manna he gave them was perhaps not literally bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. Alternate translations: “food” or “food like bread” (See: Bread and Metaphor)

### Chronology

[16:34–36](https://ref.ly/Exod16:34-Exod16:36) are written from a much later perspective. Translators will need to find a way to show that this portion gives background information from a much later point (at least 40 years).

### Box of the Covenant

Related to the chronology issue, although the covenant has not yet been made, it is referenced in [Exodus 16:34](https://ref.ly/Exod16:34). This is probably an editorial comment made after these events. (See: Covenant)

### Wilderness of Sin

Sin is the name of a part of the Sinai Wilderness. It is the description of a place, and it has nothing to do with sinning. (See: How to Translate Names)

## Exodus 16:1 (#2) (id: 393310)

**"on the fifteenth day of the second month"**

This time coincides with the end of April and the beginning of May on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

## Exodus - Chapter 17 Introduction (id: 718589)

Exodus 17 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–7: the Israelites complain and Yahweh gives them water
* v. 8–16: Israel defeats Amalek in battle

Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Rhetorical questions

Moses uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter. The purpose of these questions is to convince people of their sin. Likewise, the people’s rhetorical question shows their ignorance. (See: Rhetorical Question and Sin)

Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Wilderness of Sin

Sin is the name of a part of the Sinai Wilderness. It is not the description of a place, and it has nothing to do with the act of sinning. (See: How to Translate Names)

### Naming

As in the last couple of chapters, places and things are named for what happens in that location. In this chapter is Massah (which means “test”), Meribah (“arguing”), and an altar named “Yahweh is my Banner,” because Yahweh will be at war with the Amalekites forever.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 17:15

## Exodus 17:16 (#1) (id: 393388)

**"Because a hand was against the throne of Yah"**

The Hebrew here is very difficult, and there are a variety of opinions regarding the meaning. Questions include: (1\) Whose hand is referred to? Amalek’s, Yahweh’s, or Moses’? (2\) What is the hand on (or against)? Yahweh’s throne or banner? (3\) What is the meaning of the Hebrew preposition meaning on, against, or above? What does that signify? Rebellion, or taking an oath, or holding onto a symbol of power? If there is another translation in your region, it may be best to simply follow the interpretation it gives. Alternate translation: “Because a hand was on the throne of Yah” or “Because a hand was on the banner of Yah”

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 17:16

## Exodus 17:16 (#2) (id: 393389)

**"war is to Yahweh against Amalek"**

This phrase has no verbs in Hebrew. You may need to translate the noun **war** as a verb. Alternate translation: “Yahweh will make war with Amalek” or “Yahweh will war against Amalek”

Exodus 18 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–12: Jethro visits Moses and hears all that Yahweh has done
* v. 13–27: Jethro observes Moses and advises him to set up a subsidiarity leadership structure; Moses does so

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Leadership lessons

Jethro taught Moses an important leadership lesson in this chapter. Many scholars look at this chapter for important leadership lessons. Moses delegated some of his responsibilities to other godly men so that he would not become worn out by all the demands made of him. (See: Godly)

Possible Translation Difficulties
---------------------------------

### Order of events

The timing of the events in [18:2](https://ref.ly/Exod18:2) is not clear and, whatever their timing, may be difficult to translate. The question: Is Jethro’s **taking** Zipporah related to the past event of Moses sending her back to him at some otherwise unmentioned point in time, or is Jethro’s **taking** related to his coming to meet Moses in [18:5](https://ref.ly/Exod18:5).

### Verse 11

[18:11](https://ref.ly/Exod18:11) is difficult in the original and requires interpretation.

### God and Yahweh

In this chapter, God, who is named Yahweh in much of the rest of the book, is mostly referred to as God instead of by his name as is usual. Translations should not suggest that they are not different beings.

### Kinship: Father\-in\-law

Jethro is the father of Moses’ wife. Some languages may make a distinction between that and a woman’s father\-in\-law. If that is the case, note it in verses: 1–2, 5–8, 12, 14–15, 17, 24, and 27\. (See: Kinship)

### Participant reference

Jethro is often referred to simply as the father\-in\-law of Moses in this chapter. He is also named explicitly (referred to by name) an unusually high number of times (it would be more usual to have more pronouns referring to him). Frequent use of his name is likely to emphasize his familial ties and authority (or honored status). Some languages may need to alter the way he is referred to for naturalness or to convey the same sense of familial ties and authority (or honored status).

Exodus 19 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter consist of a series of Moses going up Mount Sinai, talking to Yahweh, coming down, and talking to the people. He is being the intermediary, carrying messages between Yahweh and the people.

* v. 1–2: Arrival at Sinai
* v. 3–8: First cycle of Moses going up and down for instruction and response
* v. 9–15: Second cycle, people get ready to hear God
* v. 16–19: God speaks to the people from the mountain
* v. 20–25: Third cycle

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### “A kingdom of priests”

The function of the priests was to intercede for the people. The Levites were the only priests in Israel; this is a metaphor indicating that the nation was to intercede for the world as a whole. They were also to be holy, or set apart, from the rest of the world. (See: Priest and Metaphor and Holy)

### Revealing the law

The events of this chapter are concerned with preparing the people to receive the law of Moses. The people go through all of this to prepare themselves for the law, which shows the great importance of this event for Israel. (See: Law of Moses)

### Boundaries between Yahweh and the people

Moses is told to make the people holy in preparation for meeting Yahweh, then boundaries are set up to keep the people separate from Yahweh, and then the priests are told to make themselves holy. The theme of a holy separation is beginning to be developed that will become much of the law code.

**"In the third month"** \- **"on the same day"**

This means they arrived at the wilderness on the first day of the month just as they left Egypt on the first day of the month. The first day of the third month on the Hebrew calendar is near the middle of May on Western calendars. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here.

## Exodus - Chapter 20 Introduction (id: 718592)

Exodus 20 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* v. 1–17: Yahweh gives the Ten Commandments
* v. 18–21: the people react
* v. 22–26: Yahweh gives a little more explanation about idols and altars

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Covenant

Yahweh’s covenant faithfulness is now based on the covenant he made with Abraham as well as the covenant he is making with Moses. (See: Covenant Faith and Covenant)

### Form of you

The singular form of you is used in the commandments; however, the commandments applied to the whole Israelite community. There is both a singular and a corporate aspect to them. You may need to choose between singular and plural if your language makes that distinction. (See: Singular Pronouns that refer to Groups)

## Exodus - Chapter 21 Introduction (id: 718593)

Exodus 21 General Notes
=======================

This chapter begins to give the Israelite civil case law, that is, the explanation of how to apply the principles condensed in the ten commandments.

Structure:
----------

* 1: Introduction
* 2–6: Laws regarding male slaves
* 7–11: Laws regarding female slaves
* 12–17: Capital crimes
* 18–36: Liability laws

    + 18–27: Regarding human violence
        + 28–36: Regarding damage done by or to animals

Translation Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------

### Hypothetical situations

Throughout the case law, a hypothetical situation is introduced with “when” or “if.” It is followed by a description of the situation; then there is the penalty or action to be taken in those situations. A hypothetical person may be introduced with “anyone” or “whoever.” Most verses for the next several chapters will have these hypothetical situations. See: Connect — Hypothetical Conditions Translators familiar with Hebrew may want to notice that, generally, major divisions are introduced by כִּי (ki) and minor divisions within a topic are introduced by אִם (’im).

### Passive construction

Many portions of these situations are written in the passive voice. Some languages may have to change all or some of these to active voice. See: Active or Passive.

### Daughters sold as servants

The section from [21:7–11](https://ref.ly/Exod21:7-Exod21:11) may be somewhat confusing because a daughter that is sold as a servant is seamlessly connected to her becoming someone’s wife. It seems the two things could be closely related.

### Ransom payment

In [21:30](https://ref.ly/Exod21:30) a man whose bull killed someone may evade the death penalty by paying a ransom price, but the conditions for that happening are not clear.

This is the first of many hypothetical situations, introduced by “when” or **if,** which you will encounter over the next several chapters. See the chapter 21 Intro. You will need to translate these consistently in a manner that expresses that these situations have not happened.

## Exodus 21:3 (#1) (id: 393511)

**"If he came by himself, he shall go free by himself"**

What **by himself** means can be stated clearly. Some languages require that the additional condition, that he marries while a slave, be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “If he became a slave while he had no wife, and if he marries while he is a slave, the master need only free the man”

## Exodus 21:6 (#1) (id: 393516)

**"God"**

The word for **God** at its most literal means “great ones.” Here it may have this basic meaning and refer to human judges or other leaders in Israel. It may also be a metonym and refer to the judges because they represent God to the people and have his authority. Texts other than the standard Hebrew text support this reading. See [Exodus 22:8–9](https://ref.ly/Exod22:8-Exod22:9) for another example of this. Alternate translation: “the judges”

## Exodus 21:21 (#1) (id: 393548)

**"for he is his silver"**

A common view is that the loss of the valuable property, the slave, is itself a punishment. It may be that the master loses the slave for a time and also has to pay for his healing, or it may be that the slave dies after a few days. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that the servant was valuable to his master explicitly.

## Exodus 21:22 (#1) (id: 393549)

**"and her children come out, but there is no serious injury"**

It is not clear in the passage what happens to the child. The text is simply as in the ULT. Some have taken it to mean that the child dies because of premature birth, and the **serious injury** only relates to the woman. In this case, a fine is imposed for the loss of the child. However, the text could also mean that the child is born safely. A fine is still imposed because of the great danger to the two lives. Then the next few verses give consequences for any injury either to mother or child.

**"then you shall give a life for a life"**

## Exodus 21:30 (#1) (id: 393563)

**"If a ransom is imposed on him, he shall give the ransom of his life, according to all that is imposed on him"**

The text does not specify who will impose a ransom on the ox’s owner. Since other texts indicate that justice is retributive and performed by the dead person’s family, that is one option. Another option is that the judges will impose it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express one of these explicitly.

## Exodus 21:30 (#2) (id: 393564)

**"If a ransom is imposed on him,"** \- **"is imposed on him"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. However, you must make a decision regarding who is imposing the ransom or use an unspecified pronoun, if that is possible in your language (this second option would not make sense in English).

## Exodus 21:32 (#1) (id: 393567)

**"thirty silver shekels"**

In ancient times, a silver shekel weighed about 11 grams or about a third of an ounce. You could try to express the equivalent in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. Instead, you could say something general like “30 silver coins” or give the equivalent weight or use the biblical term in the text and explain the weight in a footnote. Alternate translation: “330 grams of silver”

## Exodus - Chapter 22 Introduction (id: 718594)

Exodus 22 General Notes
=======================

Structure
---------

This chapter continues the list of case laws for Israel. We will not attempt to provide an outline since almost every verse is about a different case.

Translation Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------

### Hypothetical situations

Throughout the case law a hypothetical situation is introduced with “when” or “if.” Then there is a description of the situation, and then there is the penalty or action to be taken in those situations. A hypothetical person may be introduced with “anyone” or “whoever.” Most verses for the next several chapters will contain these hypothetical situations. See: Connect — Hypothetical Conditions Translators familiar with Hebrew may want to notice that, generally, major divisions are introduced by כִּי (ki) and minor divisions within a topic are introduced by אִם (’im).

### Passive construction

Many portions of these situations are written in the passive voice. Some languages may have to change all or some of these to active voice. See: Active or Passive.

Structure
---------

This chapter continues the list of case laws for Israel.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

To **blind the clear\-sighted** is a metaphor that means causing those who know what is right to act like they do not. And **perverts the words of the righteous** could mean causes those who would speak the truth (in court) to lie or causes the judge to give an evil judgment or causes those listening to **the words of the righteous** to choose to act as if they had heard something different. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for a bribe causes those who understand the right thing to do not to do it and causes good men to speak lies”

**"Aviv"**

**Aviv** is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. Aviv is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. See how you translated this in [Exodus 13:4](https://ref.ly/Exod13:4). You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

## Exodus - Chapter 24 Introduction (id: 718596)

Exodus 24 General Notes
=======================

Structure
---------

* v. 1–2: Yahweh summons Moses
* v. 3–8: Moses reads the covenant and the people accept it; this is ritually marked by sacrifice and sprinkling of blood
* v. 9–11: Moses and Israelite elders go up the mountain, see God and eat
* v. 12–15: Yahweh summons Moses further up the mountain without the other elders, and he goes
* v. 16–18: Description of Yahweh’s glory, and Moses is at the top of the mountain

Potential Translation Issues
----------------------------

* there are a number of similes used to describe people’s encounter with God
* “covenant” appears in a variety of ways
* the mountain, the mountain of God, and Mount Sinai are all the same location

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Moses’ covenant

The people of Israel promise to obey the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. Their continued blessings were contingent upon their obedience to this covenant. (See: Promise and Covenant)

### God’s holiness

Because Yahweh is perfectly holy, he can only be approached in a certain way. Because of this, only Moses was allowed near Yahweh. This is also why Yahweh is described as a “devouring fire.” (See: Holy)

## Exodus 24:14 (#1) (id: 393732)

**"And he had said to the elders"**

The structure of the Hebrew indicates but does not require that this speech by Moses happened before [24:13](https://ref.ly/Exod24:13) (hence **had said**). The ULT takes this view, however, for languages where it is hard to express events out of order, the UST reflects the other grammatical possibility and says in [24:13](https://ref.ly/Exod24:13) that Moses started up the mountain and in [24:15](https://ref.ly/Exod24:15) that he went the rest of the way up the mountain. Following this, you can view this verse as if Moses paused and gave these final instructions as he was leaving the elders behind, thus keeping a sequential structure. Either approach is permissible by the text, but the approach of the ULT is preferred, if possible.

## Exodus - Chapter 25 Introduction (id: 718597)

Exodus 25 General Notes
=======================

Structure:
----------

* v. 1–7: Instructions for gifts the Israelites may give to help build the place where they will worship God
* v. 8–9: Introductory building instructions
* v. 10–22: Instructions for building the Box of the Testimony
* v. 23–30: Instructions for building the table
* v. 31–39: Instructions for building the lampstand
* v. 40: Summary instruction

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

* The tent of meeting and Box of the Testimony are introduced in this chapter.
* Translators will need to take special care in translating the concept of atonement.

Potential Translation Issues in this Chapter:
---------------------------------------------

* There are many unfamiliar items in this chapter. Fortunately they are mostly all physical items. Translators will have to try to understand what each item is and translate it into the closest equivalent in their culture. It may be helpful for translators to try to find images depicting some of the items the Israelites were to make.
* There are some biblical weights and measurements that translators may not have encountered before.
* From [25:11](https://ref.ly/Exod25:11) until the end of chapter 30, almost every instruction regarding the construction of the tent of meeting and all the associated items are given with a singular form of “you,” as if Moses himself would make them. However, it is clear and made explicit in [chapter 31](https://ref.ly/Exod0:0) that certain skilled craftsmen will receive these instructions from Moses and make these items. In some languages you may need to change from second to third person throughout, following the pattern in [25:10](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10). There are a few exceptions which will have their own note. See: First, Second or Third Person and Singular Pronouns that refer to Groups.

## Exodus 25:2 (#1) (id: 393743)

**"Speak"**

The beginning of this verse marks the start of a very long direct quote which continues until the end of [Exo 30:10](https://ref.ly/Exod30:10). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation.

* **Associated Articles:** Quote Markings (ID: 33306)

## Exodus 25:2 (#2) (id: 393744)

**"Speak to the sons of Israel, and they shall take a contribution for me"**

In some languages you may have to make **and they shall take a contribution for me** a direct quote. Note that this will make it a second\-level quotation and you will need to mark it with second\-level quotation marking if your language uses them. Alternate translation: “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘You shall take a contribution for me.’”

**"and blue and purple and worm of scarlet"**

This could mean: (1\) “material that is dyed blue, purple, and scarlet,” probably wool yarn, or (2\) “blue, purple and scarlet dye” to dye the linen. The original audience would have known what was meant. This material seems to have been used for embroidery later, so “yarn” or “thread” may be the best understanding.

**"And you shall cast four rings of gold for it"**

Casting rings was a process in which gold was melted, poured into a mold that was in the shape of a ring, and then allowed to cool and harden. If this sort of metal\-working process is unknown to your people, you may simply describe it, or use a word meaning “make,” as the UST does. The UST approach is preferred, as the creation process is not in focus here, and it would be cumbersome to include the description in the text. You could use a word meaning “make,” and include the description in a footnote if you are including those and your team feels it is important to understand. Alternate translation: “You shall make four rings of gold by melting the gold and pouring it into molds”

These two phrases mean similar things. Yahweh is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how important this command is.

Exodus 26 General Notes
=======================

* The sacred tent has four layers (from inside to out): linen, goats’ hair, tanned rams’ skins, and fine leather.
* There are multiple different curtains described using three different Hebrew words: one sort of curtains to make the walls of the tent ([26:1–13](https://ref.ly/Exod26:1-Exod26:13)), another to separate the Holy Place and Most Holy Place (also known as Holy of Holies) ([26:31–34](https://ref.ly/Exod26:31-Exod26:34)), and another for the entrance of the sacred tent ([26:36–37](https://ref.ly/Exod26:36-Exod26:37)). If there are words in your language that would make a distinction between these sorts of hanging cloths, it would be appropriate to make a distinction in your translation.

* The verb **make** at the beginning of [27:9](https://ref.ly/Exod27:9) is the only verb from verses 9–18\. Some languages may be able to translate a clause chain this long without additional verbs. Others (including English), will need to supply at least a minimum number of verbs (ULT) or quite a few verbs (UST) for naturalness.

Exodus 29 General Notes
=======================

Large translation teams working on multiple books at the same time should note that this chapter is very similar to Leviticus 8\.

Structure
---------

As you translate, you may perceive a different structure in this chapter than what is below. Feel free to organize in a way that is clear in your language. This chapter is really one united whole; the outline below is one possible way of subdividing it. The Consecration of the Priests

* v. 1–3 Preparing items
* v. 4–9 Preparing Aaron and his sons
* v. 10–14 Sacrificing the bull to purify the altar
* v. 15–34 Sacrificing the rams

    + v. 15–18 The first ram wholly burned
        + v. 19–28 The second ram used for consecrating and divided for eating
        + v. 29–30 Priestly succession
        + v. 31–34 More instructions regarding eating the second ram
* v. 35–37 Instructions to do all this for seven days
* v. 38–41 Instructions for perpetual offerings
* v. 42–46 Yahweh’s affirmation

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Consecrating priests

This chapter records the process of consecrating priests. The priests were to be set apart from the rest of Israel because Yahweh is holy. (See: Consecrate and Priest and Holy)

Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Forms of you

For this chapter, it seems that the singular “you” that Yahweh has been using to give Moses general instructions for the last several chapters now actually refers to Moses himself. If you have been translating the instructions using a plural form of you or by shifting the instructions to the third person, you should switch back to a singular form referring directly to Moses for this chapter.

### “I will live among the Israelites”

As God, Yahweh is everywhere and cannot be limited to a single space. This phrase indicates that he permanently remains within Israel in a special way while they have the ark.

## Exodus - Chapter 30 Introduction (id: 718602)

Exodus 30 General Notes
=======================

This chapter is mostly a return to instructions for building worship equipment for the sacred tent. The forms of “you” are mostly singular. However, they again refer to the workmen that Moses will instruct, so you should return to whatever form you have been following in chapters 25–28\.

Structure:
----------

* v. 1–10: Incense altar

    + v. 1–6: Instructions for making the incense altar
        + v. 7–10: Use of the incense altar
* v. 11–16: Ransom money for taking a census
* v. 17–21: Instructions for a washbasin
* v. 22–30: Anointing oil

    + v. 22–25: Instructions for making the oil
        + v. 26–33: Instructions for using the oil v\- 34–38: Making and using sacred incense

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Atonement

Through the offering of blood and money, things and people were kept in God’s favor. (See: Atonement)

### Holiness

Some items in this chapter became so holy that they could make other things holy. (See: Holy)

### Unknown terms

There are a number of ingredient terms that are unknown even to scholars.

## Exodus - Chapter 32 Introduction (id: 718604)

Exodus 32 General Notes
=======================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

The events in verses 1–6 of this chapter occured while Moses spoke with God and therefore happened sometime during the events recorded between Exodus 24:15 and Exodus 31\. (See: Connect — Simultaneous Time Relationship)

* v. 1–6: The people ask Aaron to make them a god and he makes the golden calf
* v. 7–29 \- Yahweh and Moses’ reaction

    + v. 11–14 \- Moses intercedes for the people
* v. 30–34 \- Moses intercedes for the people

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 32:18\.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Idolatry

The making of the golden calf was considered a form of idolatry. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:1
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273); Connect — Simultaneous Time Relationship (ID: 33334)

## Exodus 32:1 (#1) (id: 394133)

**""**

This chapter begins with a major scene shift, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language.

See: Introduction of a New Event

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:1
* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Exodus 32:1 (#2) (id: 394134)

**"And the people saw"**

Here, the word **saw** is used to indicate understanding or realization of a situation. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the people realized”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Exodus 32:1 (#3) (id: 394135)

**"and the people gathered themselves"**

This means the people both decided to gather and were the ones gathering. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this.

See: Reflexive Pronouns

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:1
* **Associated Articles:** Reflexive Pronouns (ID: 33309)

## Exodus 32:1 (#4) (id: 394136)

**"Arise"**

**Arise** strengthens the force of the command following it. The people were demanding that Aaron make an idol for them. It did not necessarily mean that he should literally stand up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:1
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Exodus 32:1 (#5) (id: 394137)

**"shall go before our faces"**

Here, **before our faces** means ahead of. The Israelites want idols to lead them. Alternate translation: “shall lead us” or “shall be our leader”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Exodus 32:1 (#6) (id: 394138)

**"for this Moses"**

People showed disrespect by putting the word **this** before his name, as if Moses were someone they did not know and could not trust. They were creating social distance between him and themselves. When translating, use a form in your language that communicates the same sense of disassociation between people.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:1

## Exodus 32:2 (#1) (id: 394139)

**"and bring them"**

Here, **them** refers to the golden rings.

* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: 33424)

## Exodus 32:3 (#1) (id: 394140)

**"all the people"**

This refers to all the people who rejected Moses as their leader and Yahweh as their God. Later parts of the text reveal that there were people still faithful to Moses and Yahweh and that the Israelites had a great deal more gold. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that means many or most. Alternate translation: “many people”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 32:3
* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: 33281)

## Exodus 32:4 (#1) (id: 394141)

**"and fashioned it with a tool, and he made a calf of molten metal"**

Most likely this means that Aaron melted the gold and poured it into a mold that had the shape of a calf. When the gold cooled and became hard, he removed the mold, and the hardened gold had the shape of a calf.

## Exodus 32:4 (#3) (id: 394143)

**"These are your gods,"** \- **"brought you up"**

Because the speaker of this sentence is unknown and mentioned in the plural, it is possible that it is the people speaking. In that case, it would be possible for a translation to use the first person rather than second person here. Alternate translation: “These are our gods … brought us up”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Exodus 32:6 (#1) (id: 394148)

**"to play"**

This word may imply drunken and sexual sin (for a sexual implication see [Genesis 26:8](https://ref.ly/Gen26:8)). However, the only actions mentioned in the text are singing ([18](https://ref.ly/Exod32:18)) and dancing ([19](https://ref.ly/Exod32:19)), so translators should avoid using a term that is overly suggestive. Alternate translation: “to revel”

**"They have quickly turned from the way that I commanded them"**

Here God speaks of the people disobeying what he commanded them as if he had told them to walk on a certain road, and they left that road. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They have quickly stopped doing what I commanded them to do” or “They have quickly stopped obeying what I commanded them to do”

**"is a people hard of neck"**

Yahweh speaks of the people being rebellious as if they had hard necks. The image comes from an animal that does not want to go the way his master is trying to direct him (not going in the way God commanded).

**"Yahweh, why does your nose burn against your people whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand"**

Moses used this question to try to persuade Yahweh not to be so angry with his people. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

**""There is not the sound of singing of strength,"**

The poetic form here is parallelism in the repetition of **sound of singing**. If it would be unclear to say that Moses heard **the sound of singing** in the third line after saying he didn’t hear the sound of singing twice before, something more like the more contrastive UST may be followed.

**"and for putting a blessing on yourselves today"**

This phrase is difficult to interpret. Several options depend on exactly how the conjunction, preposition, and verb combination are interpreted. The first difficulty is related to the difficulty with the previous verb: have they already been blessed or are they going to be blessed? (Alternate translation: “to have put a blessing on yourselves today”) The second difficulty is: should the clause connections be understood to say that the blessing is because of their actions, or more strongly, that a desire for blessing motivated them to take action? (Alternate translation: “and therefore a blessing is put on you today” or “so that a blessing may be put over you today”) The third difficulty is: while ultimately all blessing is from Yahweh, which is the subject here, Yahweh or the Levites? (Alternate translation: “and so Yahweh is putting a blessing on you today”) As with the previous clause, you may want to follow the decision of another translation your people are familiar with. Alternate translation: “, by that you brought blessing on yourselves”

## Exodus - Chapter 33 Introduction (id: 718605)

Exodus 33 General Notes
=======================

This chapter is largely about Moses continuing to negotiate for a closer relationship between Yahweh and himself and Yahweh and the people. There are a number of important theological issues addressed, especially Yahweh’s holiness and character. Several key terms appear.

Structure:
----------

* v. 1–6: Moses negotiating with Yahweh to go with Israel
* v. 7–11: the temporary tent of meeting
* v. 12–23: Moses negotiating with Yahweh to see his glory

Potential Translation Issues
----------------------------

Yahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4, so in some languages you may need to reverse them.

Verses 7–11 seem to be background, general information about a somewhat unspecified time period. Be sure this is clear in how you structure these verses. See the beginning of verse 7 in the UST. While the term in verses 7–11 is often used interchangeably with the Dwelling that will be built in chapters 35–39, it is a temporary and different tent. One distinguishing feature is that it is well outside the camp, while the Dwelling will be in the center of the camp.

The word **tent** in verses 7–11 refers either to this temporary “tent of meeting” that Moses set up or to the tents that the Israelites lived in. Pay attention throughout these verses to which tent is referred to.

* **Associated Passages:** EXO 33:1

## Exodus 33:1 (#1) (id: 394214)

**"saying, ‘I will give it to your seed"**

The words which follow **saying** are a second\-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second\-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the layers of quotations in this passage. See UST.

**"and he would speak"**

Grammatically, the most likely referent for this pronoun is the **pillar of cloud**. By metonymy and based on [33:11](https://ref.ly/Exod33:11), this probably refers to Yahweh.

**"And all of the people saw the pillar of cloud standing {at} the entrance of the tent, and all of the people would get up and bow down, each {at} the entrance of his tent"**

This verse uses contrastive parallelism. The presence of Yahweh is represented in the cloud that stands at the entrance of the tent, while the people prostrate themselves at the entrance to their tents. It would be good to try to retain the contrasting image in your translation if possible.

**"And in what then will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? {Is it} not in your going with us? And I and your people shall be distinct from all of the people that {are} on the face of the earth"**

This verse contains two or three rhetorical questions, and the length of the second is debated. The first rhetorical question, “**And in what then will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people?**” is used for emphasis and means, “There is only one way people will know that I and your people please you.” The second, “**Is it not in your going with us?**” is used to answer the first question and means “That way is your going with us.” It is possible that the rest of the verse is (1\) a statement further clarifying how Yahweh’s favor is demonstrated (ULT, UST), (2\) an extension of the second rhetorical question (“Is it not in your going with us so that I and your people shall be distinct from all of the people that are on the face of the earth?”), or (3\) a separate rhetorical question making the same point (“And shall I and your people be distinct from all of the people that are on the face of the earth?”) Moses used these questions in order to emphasize that if Yahweh does not go with them, no one will know that Yahweh is pleased with Moses and the people. Use whatever forms would be natural in your language to present an argument like this. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

## Exodus - Chapter 34 Introduction (id: 718606)

Exodus 34 General Notes
=======================

Outline
-------

* v. 1–4 Yahweh orders Moses to return to the mountain
* v. 5–9 Yahweh reveals himself to Moses and Moses reacts
* v. 10–28 Covenant renewal
* v. 29–34 Moses reports to Israel

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

* In verse 1, Yahweh says he will write on stone tablets, yet later (v. 27–28\) he commands Moses to write and the text says Moses writes.
* Yahweh reveals something significant about himself or his character to Moses. There are a number of difficult terms and concepts.
* The biblical metaphor of true worship as sexual fidelity appears in v. 14–16\.
* Several verses are repeated either exactly or closely from earlier chapters.
* In v. 12–26 Yahweh appears to give a different 10 commandments from those in Exodus 20 (but also largely repeated from other earlier parts of Exodus), raising the question of what was actually written on the stone tablets in v. 28\.
* The concept of Moses’s shining face may be difficult in some cultures.

### “He will bring the punishment for the fathers’ sin on their children”

This phrase does not mean that a child is necessarily punished for the sins of their parents. Many scholars believe that this passage indicates that a parent’s sins will have consequences that will affect their children and grandchildren. (See: Sin)

## Exodus 34:1 (#1) (id: 394283)

**"And Yahweh said to Moses"**

Yahweh continues to speak to Moses, but there is a change of topic here, so you may want to retain the speech introduction. However, if it would be misunderstood, you could simply continue the quotation from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Yahweh continued”

The repeated word **jealous** means that God is concerned to keep his honor. If his people worship other gods, he loses honor, because when his people do not honor him, other people also will not honor him. This is pictured in a metaphor of a jealous spouse who is concerned that his spouse be faithful to him. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. The UST makes this image explicit as a simile, which can be done occasionally but would probably be too long for repeated use in a translation.

The metaphor is not quite as clear with the other nations because while Yahweh is the only true God, he is not in special covenant with the other nations as their god.

**"Aviv,"** \- **"Aviv"**

This is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. **Aviv** is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. See how you translated **Aviv** in [Exodus 13:4](https://ref.ly/Exod13:4). You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

This festival celebrated the final harvesting of all the crops for the year. This festival was also known as the Festival of Shelters or the Festival of Booths. The idea came from the practice of the farmers living in temporary booths, or huts, out in the fields to guard the crop as it ripened. See Deuteronomy 16:13\.

Exodus 35 General Notes
=======================

Structure
---------

* v. 1–3: reiteration of Sabbath command
* v. 4–9: list of materials for donation (See: [Exodus 25:1–7](https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod25:7))
* v. 10–19: things they need to make for the Dwelling complex
* v. 20–29: the people bring all the things listed
* v. 30–36:1: appointing of lead craftsmen to build these things

Translation Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------

* In the last chapter some repetition of Yahweh’s instructions began, mostly around the covenant commands. Starting in this chapter and even more so in chapter 36, the commands regarding the construction of the Dwelling complex are repeated, often word for word, from chapters 25–31\. In many verses the only difference will be a change of verb form from instruction to completion. As much as possible, these parallels will be pointed out for the translators with links to the previous verses. Translators should refer back to the previously translated verses for consistency and because notes in this section may not cover everything that was covered in the initial instruction section.
* Many items, materials, and processes for building the Dwelling may be unknown, but should have already been addressed in chapters 25–31\.

A beka is 1/2 a shekel. A shekel is 11 grams. There were evidently shekels of more than one weight at the time; **by the shekel of the sanctuary** specified which one was to be used. See [38:24](https://ref.ly/Exod38:24). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or a footnote.

Exodus 39 General Notes
=======================

* This chapter continues the record of the construction in almost exact repetition of Yahweh’s instructions. The special, holy clothing mentioned in previous chapters is produced to the correct specifications in this chapter. (See: Holy) Be sure to consult your previous work to maintain consistency. Verses 1–31 of this chapter follow [Exodus 28:1–37](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:37) with some differences. Verses 33–41 follow [35:10–19](https://ref.ly/Exod35:10-Exod35:19).
* Throughout the chapter the people making the items are referred to interchangeably as **he** or **they**. Both are generic nouns referring to any of the team of skilled craftsmen. You could change all instances to “they” or “he” if that would be understood better in your language. (See: Generic Noun Phrases and First, Second or Third Person)

Exodus 40 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* In this chapter, **just as Yahweh commanded Moses** is repeated seven times, as in the previous chapter, to show that Moses was obedient to every detail of Yahweh’s command.
* This chapter is repetitive both internally and with other parts of the book. Verses 17–33 parallel verses 2–8 in an expanded way.

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

* The **Dwelling** and **tent of meeting** are the same thing, but both appear next to each other many times in this chapter. The two interchangeable terms are brought together throughout this chapter in a poetic doubling to bring book to a close. If your readers would find this confusing, you may need to simplify to one or expand in explanation like in the UST.
* This chapter says that Moses did all these things. Just like with Bezalel in earlier chapters, it would have been impossible for him to do all this personally. The people helped him set up the Dwelling. In many translations this will more clear if you make this explicit.
* “the glory of Yahweh filled the Dwelling”: This phrase indicates that Yahweh began to dwell within the Dwelling, among Israel, in a special way. (See: Glory and Tabernacle)

## Exodus 40:18 (#1) (id: 394631)

**"And Moses raised up the Dwelling and placed its bases"**

Moses was the leader. It would have been impossible for him to do all this personally; the people helped him set up the Dwelling. All references to Moses from here to all the Dwelling assembly listing through [40:33](https://ref.ly/Exod40:33) can be understood this way. Alternate translation: “And Moses directed the people to raise up the Dwelling, and they placed its bases”

## Exodus 40:20 (#1) (id: 394632)

**"And he took"** \- **"And he put"**

In this verse and the next, there may be an exception to the word **he** meaning someone who was helping Moses, because these items were especially sacred. If you have been using a form that indicates that people are helping Moses construct the Dwelling, you may consider switching to “Moses” here.

**"And Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting, because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of Yahweh had filled the Dwelling"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of Yahweh had filled the Dwelling, Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting.”

## Exodus 40:38 (#2) (id: 394642)

**"the house of Israel"**

Here, **house** represents a people group, the Israelites, who were descended from Jacob, who was also named Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a metaphor from your language or translate the meaning. This is a common biblical metaphor, so you may want to check other places this occurs. The **house of Israel** is equivalent to “sons of Israel” or “Israelites.”

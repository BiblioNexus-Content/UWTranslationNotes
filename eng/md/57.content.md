## Philemon 1:1 (#1) (id: 247751)

**"Paul"**

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Use that here. Alternate translations: “From me, Paul” or “I, Paul”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: 33256)

## Philemon 1:1 (#2) (id: 247752)

**"a prisoner of Christ Jesus"**

Paul was in prison because people in authority did not want him to preach about Jesus. They put him there in order to stop him and to punish him. This does not mean that Jesus had put Paul in prison. Alternate translation: “a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus”

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:1

## Philemon 1:1 (#3) (id: 247753)

**"our brother"**

Paul is using the term **brother** to mean someone who shares the same faith. Alternate translation: “our fellow Christian” or “our companion in the faith” (See: rc://\*/ta/man/translate/figs\-metaphor)

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:1

## Philemon 1:1 (#4) (id: 247754)

**"our brother"**

Here, the word **our** is not in the original, but was necessary for English, which requires that a relationship word indicate who the person is related to. In this case, **our** would be inclusive, relating Timothy to Paul and the readers as a brother in Christ. If your language requires this, you could do the same. If not, you could follow the original wording, which says, “the brother.”

**"our sister"**

Here, the word **our** is not in the original, but was necessary for English, which requires that a relationship word indicate who the person is related to. In this case, **our** would be inclusive, relating Apphia to Paul and the readers as a sister in Christ. If your language requires this, you could do the same. If not, you could do the same as the original, which says, “the sister.”

## Philemon 1:2 (#5) (id: 247763)

**"to Apphia"** \- **"to Archippus"** \- **"to the church"**

The letter is predominantly addressed to Philemon. It could be misleading to suggest Paul is writing to **Apphia**, **Archippus**, and **the church** in Philemon’s house, on the same level as he is writing to Philemon.

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:2

## Philemon 1:2 (#6) (id: 247764)

**"our fellow soldier"**

Paul speaks here of Archippus as if he and Archippus were both soldiers in an army. He means that Archippus works hard, as Paul himself works hard, to spread the gospel. Alternate translation: “our fellow spiritual warrior” or “who also fights the spiritual battle with us”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Philemon 1:2 (#8) (id: 247766)

**"and to the church in your house"**

Apphia and Archippus were probably also members of the **church** that met at Philemon’s house. If mentioning them separately would imply that they were not part of the church, you could include a word like “other.” Alternate translation: “to the other members of the church in your house”

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:2

## Philemon 1:3 (#1) (id: 247767)

**"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ"**

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: 33257)

## Philemon 1:5 (#2) (id: 247774)

**"hearing of your love and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and for all the saints"**

Paul is using a poetic structure here in which the first and last parts relate and the second and third parts relate. Therefore, the meaning is: “hearing of the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and of your love for all the saints.”Paul said exactly that in Colossians 1:4 without the poetic structure.

See: Poetry

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:5

**"the fellowship of your faith"**

Alternate translation: “your working together with us as believers”

Paul does not say for whom this **love** is. If you need to use a verb here and say who loves whom, this could refer to: (1\) the mutual love between him and Philemon. See the UST. (2\) Paul’s love for Philemon. Alternate translation: “because I love you” (3\) Philemon’s love for his fellow believers. Alternate translation: “because I know that you love God’s people”

Here, **fathered** is a metaphor that means that Onesimus became a believer as Paul taught him about Christ. Alternate translation: “who received new life and became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ” or “who became a spiritual son to me”

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:16

## Philemon 1:17 (#1) (id: 247812)

**"if you have me {as} a partner"**

Paul is writing in a way that makes it seem as though it is possible that Philemon does not consider that Paul is his partner, but he knows that Philemon does consider Paul to be his partner. This is a way of getting Philemon to agree on one thing (that Paul is a partner) so that he will agree to the other thing (to receive Onesimus). If your language does not state something as uncertain if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you have me as a partner”

* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Factual Conditions (ID: 33326)

## Philemon 1:17 (#2) (id: 247813)

**"Therefore"**

**Therefore** means that what came before this word is the reason for what comes after it. It may be that Paul intends for everything that came before to be the reason, because this word also indicates that Paul is now coming to the main point of the letter. Use a natural method in your language to indicate this transition. Alternate translation: “Because of all of these things”

**"receive him as me"**

Paul is leaving out some of the words here that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “receive him just as you would receive me”

## Philemon 1:18 (#1) (id: 247815)

**"But if he has wronged you or owes {you} anything"**

Onesimus certainly did wrong to Philemon by running away, and he probably also stole some of Philemon’s property. But Paul is stating these things as uncertain in order to be polite. If your language does not use a conditional statement in this way, then use a more natural way to state this. Alternate translation: “But whatever he has taken or whatever wrong he has done to you”

See: Connect — Factual Conditions

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:18
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Factual Conditions (ID: 33326)

**"But if he has wronged you or owes {you} anything"**

These two phrases mean similar things, although **wronged you** is more general than **owes {you}**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the more general phrase second. Alternate translation: “But if he owes you anything or has wronged you in any way”

* **Associated Passages:** PHM 1:18

## Philemon 1:18 (#3) (id: 247817)

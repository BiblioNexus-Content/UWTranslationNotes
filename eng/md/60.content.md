## 1 Peter 1:1 (#1) (id: 256982)

**"Peter"**

In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Peter, am writing this letter” or “From Peter”

Here, **dead ones** refers to people who heard the gospel while they were alive but had died by the time Peter wrote this letter.

Joshua was the leader who replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought against the people groups that had been living in Canaan. This book then tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26128\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Promised Land</span>)</p><h3>Who wrote the book of Joshua?</h3><p>The book does not tell us who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times the Jewish people have thought that Joshua recorded much of what is in this book.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>This book has traditionally had the title “Joshua” because it tells how Joshua led the people of Israel. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests that Joshua was the writer of the book, as it is not certain how much of it he may have written.</p><h3>When should Joshua be translated?</h3><p>The book of Joshua should probably be translated after Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events described in the book of Joshua may be more difficult to understand without the information in those previous books.</p><h2>Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book</h2><h3>The term “devoted”</h3><p>The book uses a term in chapters 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 22 that the ULT translates as “devoted.” This was a specialized term that described the cultural practice of giving something over to Yahweh so that humans would no longer be able to use it. Depending on the context, the term can indicate either “destroy” or “preserve, but set apart.” The context must determine the meaning, so be sensitive to the context as you translate this term.</p><h2>Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book</h2><h3>“struck,” “struck to the mouth of the sword,” “to the mouth of the sword”</h3><p>The author often uses the expression “to the mouth of the sword” in connection with the term “devoted.” It was a common expression of his culture that referred to destroying something completely. When it appears, as it does about a dozen times in the book, it helps clarify what the term “devoted” means in a specific context. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><p>In many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, king, or kings, as if they had only hit them. But he means that they attacked those opponents, and in some contexts the meaning is clearly that they killed them. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><p>In several contexts the author uses a longer form of this expression and says Joshua and his soldiers “struck them (or it) to the mouth of the sword.” This means that they completely destroyed a city, killing everyone who lived there. For example, speaking in 11:11 of what Joshua and his army did to the inhabitants of the city of Hazor, the author says that “they struck every soul that was in it (the city of Hazor) to the mouth of the sword.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“And it happened”</h3><p>The author often uses the phrase “And it happened” to introduce a new event in the story or a new development within an episode. To translate this phrase in its various occurrences, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event or development. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26833\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Introduction of a New Event</span>)</p><h3>“unto this day”</h3><p>The author used this phrase to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time that is already past. He must avoid giving the impression to his readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to use an equivalent phrase such as “at the time of this writing.” This phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9, 5:9, 6:25, 7:26, 8:28, 29, 10:27, 13:13, 14:14, 15:63, and 16:10.</p><h3>“And now”</h3><p>Characters in the story who are making a speech or delivering a message often use the phrase “And now” to introduce their main point. That point typically relates to what they want their listeners to do in response to what they have said so far. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. For example, you might say something such as “now here is my main point” or “now here is what I want you to do.” This phrase occurs in Joshua 1:2, 2:12, 3:12, 9:6, 9:11, 9:12, 9:23, 9:25, 13:7, 14:10, 14:12, 22:4, 24:14, and 24:23.</p><h3>“hear” and “listen”</h3><p>The author and characters sometimes use the words “hear” and “listen” in a specialized sense to mean someone complying with what they have heard or listened to someone saying. When these words refer to a person, they have the sense of “obey.” When they apply to God, they indicate that God did what someone asked him to do, so you might say that God “answered” that person’s prayer. At other times, these words have a more literal sense of sound registering in the ears, that is, of a person taking in and understanding information. Be sensitive to the meaning of these words in the context as you translate them.</p><h3>The name of tribe or nation representing its people or army</h3><p>The author and characters often use the name of a nation or Israelite tribe to mean its people or its army. It may sound as if an individual with that name is doing an action, but it is actually a group of people descended from that individual. Once you are aware of this usage, the meaning should be evident from the context. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>“the sons of”</h3><p>Similarly, the author and characters often use the expression “the sons of” to mean the people or army of a nation or Israelite tribe descended from the individual who is then named. They do not mean only the literal, first-generation male descendants of that person. Once you are aware of this usage, the meaning should be evident from the context. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h3>“to the face of”</h3><p>The author and characters often use the expression “to the face of” to mean “before,” “in front of,” or “in the presence of” a person or thing. This is by association with the way one can see the face of a person who is present and the way people typically face forward, toward what is before or in front of them. This usage occurs very frequently in the book, about 60 times, and accounts for almost every instance of the word “face.” Only in 5:14 and 7:6 does the word refer literally to part of the body, where Joshua bows down with his face to the ground. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>“from your faces”</h3><p>In the phrase “from your faces” in 2:11 and 23:3 the word “from” introduces the cause of the action. In 2:11 it introduces the cause of the the inhabitants of Jericho’s fear and in 23:3 it introduces the cause of Yahweh’s action. In these two passages the word “faces” represents the Israelite people themselves, in their entirety. See the synecdoche note for the phrase “from your faces” in these two passages for more information. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26729\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Synecdoche</span>)</p><h3>“all of Israel”</h3><p>This phrase appears sixteen times in the book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every single person in the nation of Israel. Often it means the Israelite army. At other times it refers to representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel. However, in a few contexts it does seem to indicate every Israelite, as when Yahweh tells Joshua in 3:7, “This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all of Israel, who will know that just as I was with Moses, I am with you.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26695\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Hyperbole</span>)</p><h3>“shall”</h3><p>The ULT represents the Hebrew instructional verb form with the English helping verb “shall.” For example, when Deborah tells Barak in Judges 4:6 “and you shall take with you 10,000 men,” she is instructing him to take 10,000 men with him. Other ways to say this are: “you are to take 10,000 men with you” or “take 10,000 men with you.” Translate this form with the most natural way in your language for giving instructions. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26817\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Irregular Use of Tenses</span>)</p><h2>Part 4: Specific Translation Issues in Chapters 13–21</h2><p>There are some specific translation issues in the section of the book that describes the territories of the Israelite tribes and their borders.</p><h3>“inheritance”</h3><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” by association to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>“went up,” “went down”</h3><p>In Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. Such expressions occur frequently in the descriptions of tribal borders. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate such expressions more simply. For example, you could just say “went” instead of “went up” or “went down.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26687\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information</span>)</p><h3>“from” a direction “to” a place</h3><p>The author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. For example, speaking of the territory of Naphtali, he describes the territory of Asher as being “from the west” relative to it, meaning that someone would be coming from the west to go from Asher to Naphtali. In your translation, express this in the way that your culture describes the relative location of places. For example, you might say instead that Asher was “to the west” of Naphtali. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“the sea”</h3><p>When the author says “the sea,” he means the Mediterranean Sea. He calls it the Great Sea when he gives it a name. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26687\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information</span>)</p><h3>“seaward”</h3><p>The author uses the term <strong>seaward</strong> by association to mean toward the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, to the west. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>“toward the sunrise,” “from the sunrise”</h3><p>The author uses the term <strong>sunrise</strong> by association to mean the direction where the sun rises, that is, the east. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>Names in border descriptions</h3><p>All names in border descriptions are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26805\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">How to Translate Names</span>)</p>",

Joshua recognized that the Israelites would only be victorious through Yahweh’s power. This is why his first act after crossing the Jordan River was to have them build a monument of stones from the river as a witness to Yahweh’s power.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Chiasm</h3><p>Hebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary device called a “chiasm.” A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. This helped make a saying more memorable. Joshua uses a chiasm in 4:7 when he tells the Israelites what to say to their children when the ask about the monument of stones:</p><p>A Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off B from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh.

    "content": "<h1>Joshua 5 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter begins with a notice of how the kings in the land of Canaan feared Yahweh when they heard how he had dried up the Jordan River so the Israelites could cross (5:1).</p><p>The chapter then describes how the Israelites were careful to observe the law of Moses as soon as they entered the land of Canaan.</p><ul><li><p>The Israelite men were circumcised (5:2–9</p></li><li><p>All the Israelites celebrated Passover (5:10–12)</p></li></ul><p>The chapter then describes how the commander of Yahweh’s army came to help Joshua defeat his enemies (5:13–15)</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Circumcision</h3><p>This was a sign of the covenant that Yahweh had given to the Israelites through Moses. The book of Joshua explains why the Israelite men who crossed the Jordan River had not yet been circumcised. Fulfilling this sign of the covenant was an important expression of how the Israelites would obey the whole law of Moses when they settled in the land of Canaan. It also affirmed the identity of Israel as a nation. Yahweh said that by having the Israelite men circumcised, he had removed “the disgrace of Egypt.” In Numbers 22:5, King Balak referred to the Israelites simply as “a people went out from Egypt,” in other words, a horde of runaway Egyptian slaves. Now the Israelites were being clearly constituted as a distinct people group with their own laws and customs as commanded by Yahweh. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25592\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Circumcise</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“a man … standing in front of him”</h3><p>The author uses the expression “a man” to describe the figure who appears to Joshua in in 5:13, but in the next verse this figure explains that he is “the prince of the army of Yahweh.” So this is actually not a human being but more likely an angel. The author uses the phrase “a man” because that was what Joshua thought he was at first. Since this figure identifies himself in the next verse, you do not need to say anything such as “an angel who looked like a man” in 5:13 in your translation.</p>",

The chapter describes how Yahweh identified that person, a man named Achan, and how the Israelites punished him by execution for what he did.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Sin brought defeat</h3><p>It was a great sin for Achan to take what Yahweh had said was to be destroyed. Because of his sin, Yahweh withheld victory from the Israelites. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26240\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Sin</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“devoted”</h3><p>The specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.</p><h3>“went up”</h3><p>As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, Hebrew writers marked travel descriptions for change in elevation. So the author typically says “went up” when he describes how the Israelite soldiers went from Gilgal in the Jordan River valley to the city of Ai in a hilly area. If your language does not mark travel notices for change in elevation, you can translate these expressions more simply and say “went.”</p>",

Yahweh told the Israelites how to defeat the city by putting some of their soldiers in an ambush.</p><p>Joshua 8:30–35 then describes how the Israelites affirmed their covenant with Yahweh at Mount Ebal, just as Moses had told them to do.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>The altar on Mount Ebal</h3><p>By building an altar on Mount Ebal and writing out a copy of the law on the stones, Joshua was fulfilling what Moses had commanded the Israelites in Deuteronomy 11:26–32 and 27:1–26. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in a footnote.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Did Joshua put 30,000 or 5,000 soldiers in the ambush?</h3><p>Verses 3–9 seem to describe Joshua sending 30,000 soldiers to lie in ambush to the west of the city of Ai. But verse 12, which seems to be a summary of that same action, says that Joshua sent 5,000 soldiers. Interpreters explain this in different ways. Some say that verse 12 is not actually a summary and Joshua sent out two groups for two different purposes, for example, one to rush into the city and another to guard the flank of the main army or to cut off escaping soldiers. Other interpreters suggest that the original 30,000 soldiers may have realized that there were more of them than were needed for the ambush and that they could not all hide without being seen, so they returned to Joshua, and he sent back only 5,000 of them. Still other interpreters suggest that the number 30,000 could be a copyist’s error and that verse 3 should actually read “5,000.” Whatever the explanation, it is a matter of interpretation rather than translation. The Hebrew text reads “30,000” in verse 3 and “5,000” in verse 12, and we encourage you to translate the text that way.</p><h3>Descriptions of relative location</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. He tells from what direction a person would approach a certain place from the location they were in. In your translation express this in the way your culture describes the relative location of places. For example, in 8:8, you might say “to the west of Ai” rather than “from the west of Ai.”</p>",

Instead of consulting Yahweh, they reached conclusions of their own based on what they considered to be reasonable in light of the evidence they had. The Bible says instead, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov3:5\">Proverbs 3:5</a> “Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25870\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Inquire</span>)</p><h3>The Hivites</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh3:10\">3:10</a>, the Israelites are given a list of the nations that they are told to dispossess from the land. This list includes the Hivites. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:2\">9:1–2</a>, the author of Joshua records that when the kings on the west side of the Jordan River heard what the Israelites had done to Ai, they made an agreement to fight against the Israelites. The list in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:2\">9:2</a> of kings who agreed to fight against the Israelites includes “the Hivite.” The author records in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:3-Josh9:4\">9:3–4</a> that when “those who dwelled in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to the Ai … they … acted with cunning.” The author then records in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:7\">9:7</a> that those who dwelled in Gibeon were “Hivite.” The Hivite nation consisted of multiple people groups, of whom the Gibeonites were just one. This is why the author could say in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:2\">9:1–2</a> that among the kings who gathered to fight the Israelites were Hivites and also say that the Gibeonites were Hivites.</p><h3>“Cut a covenant”</h3><p>The phrase “cut a covenant” occurs several times in this chapter. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Joshua 10 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter describes how other Canaanite kings attacked the city of Gibeon because it was a great city and they were concerned because its people had allied themselves with the Israelites. The chapter also describes how Joshua and the Israelite army went and defended the city and defeated its attackers (10:1–27).</p><p>The chapter then describes how Joshua and the Israelite army went and defeated and destroyed each of the cities whose kings had attacked Gibeon, the cities of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir (10:28–43).</p><p>The ULT sets the lines in 10:12–13 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a poem.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Complete destruction of cities</h3><p>The war that the Israelites fought against the Canaanites was different from other wars. Yahweh gave Israel special instructions about how they were to deal with the people they defeated, including completely destroying them and their cities. These were unique circumstances, and armies today are not supposed to act in the same way.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“devoted”</h3><p>The specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.</p><h3>“to the mouth of the sword”</h3><p>This expression occurs several times in this chapter, often in connection with the term “devoted.” See the discussion of this expression in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see how the UST represents its meaning.</p><h3>“come up,” “went up”</h3><p>As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, Hebrew writers marked travel descriptions for change in elevation. The author follows this usage in several places in this chapter. If your language does not mark travel notices for change in elevation, you can translate these expressions more simply For example, in 10:6 you might have the Gibeonites say simply “come to us” rather than “come up to us.”</p>",

This was probably because the elevated location of those cities offered them a strategic advantage. They probably already had defensive walls. So Yahweh allowed them to live in those cities, where they would be safer and more secure from attack. It is not necessary to put anything about this in the text of your translation, but you could explain it in a footnote.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“devoted,” “to the mouth of the sword”</h3><p>The author uses these expressions several times in this chapter.

(This description continues through Chapter 21.) This chapter summarizes the land that remained for the Israelites to conquer (13:1–7) and reviews how Moses distributed the land the Israelites conquered east of the Jordan River to some of the tribes (13:8–32).</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><p>See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:</p><ol><li><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.</p></li><li><p>The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”</p></li><li><p>The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.</p></li><li><p>The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.</p></li><li><p>The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.</p></li><li><p>All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.</p></li></ol>",

It begins to describe the division of the land west of the Jordan River (14:1–5), and it relates how Joshua gave the city of Hebron and the surrounding area to Caleb (14:6–15).</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><p>See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:</p><ol><li><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.</p></li><li><p>The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”</p></li><li><p>The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.</p></li><li><p>The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.</p></li><li><p>The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.</p></li><li><p>All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.</p></li></ol>",

These issues include:</p><ol><li><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.</p></li><li><p>The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”</p></li><li><p>The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.</p></li><li><p>The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.</p></li><li><p>The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.</p></li><li><p>All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.</p></li></ol>",

It continues the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the two tribes that were descendants of Joseph. It describes the land he gave to the tribe of Manasseh (17:1–18).</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><p>See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:</p><ol><li><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.</p></li><li><p>The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”</p></li><li><p>The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.</p></li><li><p>The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.</p></li><li><p>The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.</p></li><li><p>All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.</p></li></ol>",

It begins the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the remaining tribes of Israel:</p><ul><li><p>Joshua sent men to survey and divide the remaining land (18:1–10)</p></li><li><p>Joshua assigned land to the tribe of Benjamin (18:11–28)</p></li></ul><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><p>See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:</p><ol><li><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.</p></li><li><p>The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”</p></li><li><p>The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.</p></li><li><p>The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.</p></li><li><p>The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.</p></li><li><p>All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.</p></li></ol>",

It concludes the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the remaining tribes of Israel:</p><ul><li><p>Simeon (19:1–9)</p></li><li><p>Zebulun (19:10–16)</p></li><li><p>Issachar (19:17–23)</p></li><li><p>Asher (19:24–31)</p></li><li><p>Naphtali (19:32–39)</p></li><li><p>Dan (19:40–48) The chapter also describes how the Israelites gave territory to Joshua (19:49–51)</p></li></ul><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Ordinal numbers</h3><p>In this chapter, the author uses ordinal numbers to describe the lots for each of the remaining tribes in the order in which those tribes were selected. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers or an equivalent expression.</p><h3>Translation issues specific to this section</h3><p>See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:</p><ol><li><p>The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.</p></li><li><p>The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”</p></li><li><p>The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.</p></li><li><p>The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.</p></li><li><p>The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.</p></li><li><p>All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.</p></li></ol>",

It describes how Joshua designated certain cities to be cities of refuge (20:1–9).</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Cities of refuge</h3><p>If a person was murdered, in this culture it was the duty of his relatives to provide justice by killing the murderer. However, if someone was killed by accident, it would be unfair to kill the person who had killed him accidentally. Therefore, God told the Israelites to designate “cities of refuge” to which a person who killed someone accidentally could flee. In those cities, these cases would be resolved legally. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26164\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Refuge</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25493\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Avenge</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"UnfoldingWord_TranslatorWords_blood\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">blood</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Quotes in quotes</h3><p>In verses 2–6, there is a long quotation within a quotation. Yahweh tells Joshua something that he is to tell the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Notes suggest how to do that in the cases of verses 2 and 3. The rest of the second-level quotation can be made a first-level quotation without any changes in the wording.</p><h3>Relative locations</h3><p>In listing the cities of refuge, the author often describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named. Translate these descriptions the way you have done in the previous part of this section of the book of Joshua.</p>",

It also describes how they built an altar to remind their descendants to worship Yahweh and how they resolved a misunderstanding about this altar with the other Israelites (22:1–34).</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Quotations within quotations</h3><p>In verses 16–20 and 22–29, there are long quotations that include quotations within quotations and, in verses 24–25, 27, and 28, quotations within quotations within quotations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate these so that there are not a quotations within quotations. Notes suggest ways to do this.</p><h3>“the sons of Israel”</h3><p>While this phrase typically refers to all of the Israelites, in this chapter it means specifically the people of the tribes that settled on the west side of the Jordan River. Be sure that this meaning is clear in your translation.</p><h3>“brothers”</h3><p>In this chapter, Joshua and the author use the term “brothers” to mean people who are descended from the same ancestor. In your translation, you may wish to communicate this meaning by using an expression such as “fellow Israelites.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h3>“tents”</h3><p>Joshua uses the name of one kind of dwelling, “tents,” to mean all kinds of dwellings. In your translation, you may wish to communicate this meaning by using a word such as “homes.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26729\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Synecdoche</span>)</p><h3>“tomorrow”</h3><p>In this chapter, characters use the word “tomorrow” several times to mean “in the future.” You may wish to use that phrase in your translation to communicate the meaning.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Joshua 24 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter describes how Joshua had the Israelites gather in the city of Shechem to renew their covenant with Yahweh (24:1–28). It then describes how Joshua died and was buried and how the Israelites also buried the remains of other leaders who had died (24:29–33).</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>“Cut a covenant”</h3><p>The phrase “cut a covenant” occurs in this chapter, as it did several times in Chapter 9. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“you,” “your”</h3><p>Yahweh, speaking through Joshua, often addresses the current generation of Israelites with the pronouns “you” and “your,” as if he had done the things he describes directly for them. Yahweh is actually using those pronouns to refer to the ancestors of the Israelites, the people whom he brought out of Egypt, by association with the current generation. In your translation, you could express this meaning by using expressions such as “your ancestors.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>“fathers”</h3><p>Often in this chapter, Yahweh speaks of the ancestors of the Israelites he is addressing as if they were their actual “fathers.” In your translation, you could express this meaning by using a term such as “ancestors.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h3>“the Amorite,” “the foreigner,” etc.</h3><p>Often in this chapter, Yahweh and Joshua use expressions such as “the Amorite.” They are not referring to a specific Amorite. They mean the Amorite people in general. The meaning is also general in similar instances, including “the foreigner” in verses 20 and 23. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms.

For some of the possible interpretations, see the chapter introduction. The two most likely interpretations are that: (1) <strong>she</strong> (Eve or women in general) <strong>will be saved</strong> by God, who will use <strong>childbearing</strong> as the means by which he sends the Messiah into the world. In this case, <strong>childbearing</strong> describes one means by which God accomplishes salvation. Alternate translation: “she will be saved through how the Messiah came by means of women bearing children” (2) <strong>she</strong> (women in general) <strong>will be saved</strong> spiritually as they have children and act as mothers. In this case, <strong>childbearing</strong> describes the circumstances in which the women <strong>will be saved</strong>.

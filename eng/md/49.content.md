**"pastors"**

The word translated as **pastors** here is the the same word that is translated as “shepherds” elsewhere in the ULT. It is the plural form of the word used by Jesus to refer to himself in John 10:10 where he says that he is the “good Shepherd.” The idea here is that in a similar way to how a shepherd feeds, protects, and watches over the well\-being of his flock, so pastors feed (with spiritual food) and watch over and protect the spiritual well\-being of those within their church. If it would help your readers, you could indicate explicitly the meaning of the word “pastors.” Alternate translation: “spiritual shepherds” or “shepherding Christian leaders”

## Acts 1:1 (#1) (id: 207176)

**"I made the first account"**

Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that by **the first account** he means the book that has become known as the Gospel of Luke. Since that book was not known by that title at this time, it would not be accurate to put the title in your translation as a name that Luke would have used to describe the book to Theophilus. However, you could explain this in a footnote and use another expression here. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my first volume”

## Acts 1:1 (#2) (id: 207177)

**"O Theophilus"**

Here Luke is identifying and addressing the man for whom he complied this account of the early church. Since this is like the salutation of a letter, in your translation you may wish to follow your culture’s way of identifying and greeting the addressee of a letter. UST models this by saying “Dear Theophilus” and putting the phrase at the beginning of the sentence.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:1

## Acts 1:1 (#3) (id: 207178)

**"Theophilus"**

**Theophilus** is the name of a man. It means “friend of God.” It may be his actual name, or it may describe what this man was like. Most translations treat it as his name.

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: `33391@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:1 (#4) (id: 207179)

**"about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach"**

Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that Jesus had been doing something else (working as a carpenter) but then began to do something new when he started his ministry. In your language, it might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express. Alternate translation: “all that Jesus both did and taught”

* **Associated Articles:** Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit (ID: `33274@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:1 (#5) (id: 207180)

**"about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach"**

This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “about some of the most important things that Jesus did and taught”

## Acts 1:2 (#1) (id: 207181)

**"until that day"**

While this did happen on a specific day, Luke is likely using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “up to the time when”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:2 (#2) (id: 207182)

**"he was taken up"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:2 (#3) (id: 207183)

**"he was taken up"**

Luke is referring to Jesus being **taken up** into heaven. See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “he was taken up into heaven” or “God took him up into heaven”

## Acts 1:3 (#1) (id: 207184)

**"to whom also, after he had suffered, he presented himself living with many proofs"**

As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Jesus also presented himself alive with many proofs to his apostles after he had suffered”

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:3

## Acts 1:3 (#2) (id: 207185)

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:3 (#4) (id: 207187)

**"appearing to them for 40 days and speaking"**

While the antecedent of **whom** is “the apostles whom he had chosen” in the previous verse, Jesus actually appeared to many other disciples besides his apostles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “For 40 days he appeared to his apostles and many of his other disciples, and he spoke”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:3 (#5) (id: 207188)

**"things concerning the kingdom of God"**

See the discussion of the concept of the **kingdom of God** in Part 2 of the General Introduction to Acts. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express this with a verb such as “rule,” as UST does.

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:4 (#1) (id: 207189)

**"not to depart from Jerusalem, but"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **depart**. Alternate translation: “to remain in Jerusalem and”

See: Double Negatives

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Double Negatives (ID: `33265@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:4 (#2) (id: 207190)

**"not to depart from Jerusalem"**

The content of Jesus’ instructions to the apostles on this occasion begins here. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate and punctuate the material from here to the end of the verse as a direct quotation, as UST does.

See: Quote Markings

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Quote Markings (ID: `33306@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:4 (#3) (id: 207191)

**"the promise of the Father"**

Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit by association with the way God made a **promise** to send the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit, whom the Father promised”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:4 (#4) (id: 207192)

**"of the Father"**

**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “of God the Father”

See: Translating Son and Father

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Translating Son and Father (ID: `33349@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:4 (#5) (id: 207193)

**"which you heard from me"**

In keeping with his engaging storytelling style, Luke begins a quotation from Jesus here without introducing it with a formula such as “he said.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include an introductory formula in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said, ‘You heard about this from me’” or “He said, ‘I told you about this’”

See: Direct and Indirect Quotations

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Direct and Indirect Quotations (ID: `33305@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:4 (#6) (id: 207194)

**"you heard"**

Here, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the apostles, so use the plural form of “you” in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In [1:6](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6), “you” is singular because Jesus alone is being addressed, so the singular form would be accurate there. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context, but they will address ambiguous cases where this may not be clear.

See: Forms of You

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of You (ID: `33317@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:5 (#1) (id: 207195)

**"John"**

Jesus is referring to the man who was known as John the Baptist because he baptized people. It may help to identify him if you use that title after his name in your translation. However, because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, it may be helpful to your readers to use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does by saying “Baptizer.” Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” or “John the Baptizer”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:5 (#2) (id: 207196)

**"you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit"**

After describing earlier in the verse how John baptized people literally, Jesus is using baptism in this second instance as a metaphor. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will come and empower you”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:5 (#3) (id: 207197)

**"you will be baptized"**

You may wish to retain the metaphor of baptism in your translation. If you do, and If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will baptize”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:5 (#4) (id: 207198)

**"after these not many days"**

Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “just a few days from now”

See: Litotes

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Litotes (ID: `33290@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:6 (#1) (id: 207199)

**"They therefore having assembled, they were asking him"**

In the first instance, **they** describes Jesus and the apostles, while in the second instance, **they** refers to the apostles. (Other disciples could have been present on this occasion, but the instructions that Jesus gives about being “witnesses” in [1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8) apply specifically to the apostles, so it would be good to name them directly.) Alternate translation: “When the apostles were together with Jesus, the apostles were asking him”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:6 (#3) (id: 207201)

**"if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express the same idea with a noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “are you going to give Israel its own king again” or “are you going to become the restored king of Israel”

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:7 (#1) (id: 207202)

**"It is not for you to know"**

Jesus is saying implicitly by this response that he is not going to tell the apostles when the thing they are asking about will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I am not going to tell you when that will happen, because it is not for you to know”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:10 (#1) (id: 207212)

**"they were looking intently into heaven"**

Since a cloud was able to block the apostles’ view, it is clear that Luke is using the word translated **heaven** here in one of its specific senses to mean “sky.” It would be good to make clear that the apostles were not seeing into heaven itself. Alternate translation: “gazing at the sky”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:10
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:10 (#2) (id: 207213)

**"two men"**

These were actually angels. Luke calls them **men** because they appeared in human form. Alternate translation: “two angels”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:11
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:11 (#2) (id: 207218)

## Acts 1:11 (#4) (id: 207220)

**"why do you stand looking into heaven"**

The angels are not looking for information. They are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no reason for you to stand looking into heaven!”

## Acts 1:11 (#6) (id: 207222)

**"the one having been taken up from you into heaven,"** \- **"you saw him going into heaven"**

In its second occurrence in this sentence, the term translated **heaven** likely means “the sky,” as in the previous sentence and in the previous verse. However, in its first occurrence in this sentence, the term likely means “heaven” itself. It would not be accurate to say that Jesus was just “taken up from you into the sky.” Alternate translation: “who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into the sky”

**"they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying"**

In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built on top of other rooms. The expression **upper chamber** describes such a room, which was reached by stairs.

**"James of Alphaeus"** \- **"Judas of James"**

These are the names of four men. As the UST indicates, the man named **James** who was the father of **Judas** is not the same man as the James who is mentioned first in this verse, and he is also not the same man as James the son of Alphaeus.

## Acts 1:14 (#2) (id: 207236)

**"the women"**

Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to the women who accompanied Jesus and his disciples during his ministry. These women provided for them out of their own means, and they had traveled with them to Jerusalem. These women are described in [Luke 8:2–3](https://ref.ly/Luke8:2-Luke8:3) and [23:49](https://ref.ly/Acts23:49). Alternate translation: “the women who had helped Jesus and his disciples during his ministry”

## Acts 1:14 (#3) (id: 207237)

**"his brothers"**

These were Jesus’ younger brothers. They were the sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half\-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you may wish to use it here.

**"of the brothers"**

Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Luke is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

**"and the multitude of names to the same was about 120"**

Luke provides this background information to help readers appreciate what happens shortly afterwards in the story, when the church grows in one day to many times this size. It may be helpful to put this background information first in the verse as a separate sentence, in which case it would not have to be in parentheses.

This also included meeting beforehand with his enemies, receiving payment for the betrayal, and looking for the best opportunity to catch Jesus away from the crowds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in more general terms. Alternate translation: “who betrayed Jesus to his enemies”

## Acts 1:17 (#1) (id: 207253)

**"For"**

Peter uses the word **For** to introduce the reason for a result that is described in [1:21–22](https://ref.ly/Acts1:21-Acts1:22), after Luke provides further background information and Peter quotes the scripture he referred to in [1:16](https://ref.ly/Acts1:16). The overall meaning is, “Since Judas was one of us apostles, we need to replace him with another witness of the ministry of Jesus.” But since so much material comes between the reason and the result, it may be helpful to give an indication here that Peter has a response in mind. Alternate translation: “There is something important we need to do in response to this scripture being fulfilled, since”

**"with us"**

Although Peter is addressing a larger group of people, he is using the word **us** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **us** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “with us apostles”

## Acts 1:17 (#6) (id: 207258)

**"a share of this ministry"**

Luke temporarily ends his quotation from Peter after this phrase so that he can provide further background information about Judas in [1:18–19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18-Acts1:19). The quotation resumes in [1:20](https://ref.ly/Acts1:20). If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an ending quotation mark or the equivalent after this phrase.

**"Now indeed"**

Luke is using this expression to introduce further background information that he provides in this verse and the next one about how Judas died and about what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter’s speech. You may want to indicate that by putting these verses in parentheses or by using the equivalent convention in your language.

**"this one"**

Luke is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Judas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state “he” or use the name “Judas.”

**""Let his habitation become desolate,"**

This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is asking God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear.

## Acts 1:20 (#7) (id: 207276)

**""Let his habitation become desolate,"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Or you could combine the phrases if you think that would be the clearest thing to do.

Alternate translation: “Therefore it is necessary for someone else to become a witness with us of Jesus’ resurrection.

## Acts 1:23 (#4) (id: 207295)

**"Joseph,"** \- **"Barsabbas,"** \- **"Justus"**

**Joseph** is the name of a man, and **Barsabbas** and **Justus** are two other names by which he was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. **Justus** is a Roman name, and it may be a name that this man used for official purposes and in interactions with people who spoke Latin. (It would be like the name Paul, by which Saul of Tarsus was also known in the Roman Empire.)

## Acts 1:24 (#1) (id: 207298)

**""**

Judas betrayed Jesus and abandoned his position as an apostle. The person who is praying says that in the next verse. As a result, the believers are asking God to show them whom he has chosen to replace Judas, as the person praying says in this verse. You could put the reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. UST provides a model for doing that.

## Acts 1:24 (#2) (id: 207299)

**"praying, they said"**

Together the words **praying** and **said** indicate that the believers said what they did while praying. Alternate translation: “they said in prayer” or “they prayed”

## Acts 1:24 (#3) (id: 207300)

**"praying, they said"**

The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers, but one of the apostles alone probably spoke these words on behalf of everyone. Alternate translation: “as the believers were all praying together, one of the apostles said”

## Acts 1:24 (#6) (id: 207303)

**"You, Lord"**

The word **you** is singular because the person who is praying is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form in your translation. However, it might be more natural in your language for someone who has a good, close relationship with God to address God using the informal form of “you.” Use your best judgment about what form to use here.

## Acts 1:24 (#7) (id: 207304)

**"which one from these two you have chosen"**

The person who is praying is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, the two men whom the believers have proposed. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “which one of these two men”

## Acts 1:25 (#1) (id: 207305)

**"to take this place of ministry and apostleship"**

The person who is praying is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **apostleship** identifies what kind of **ministry** this is. Alternate translation: “to take this place of apostolic ministry”

## Acts 1:26 (#2) (id: 207309)

**"they cast lots for them"**

The pronoun **they** refers to the believers and the pronoun **them** refers to Joseph and Matthias. You may want to specify that for clarity. (But if you decide to retain the pronoun **them** and if your language marks the dual form, **them** would be dual because it refers to those two men.) Alternate translation: “the believers cast lots to decide between Joseph and Matthias”

* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 1:26 (#3) (id: 207310)

**"they cast lots for them"**

The term **lots** describes objects with various markings on different sides that were used, most likely by dropping them on the ground, to select between possibilities. The belief was that God would control which way these objects fell and so guide the selection process. Alternate translation: “they threw marked objects on the ground, trusting that God would use these to guide them whether to choose Joseph or Matthias”

## Acts 2:1 (#2) (id: 207314)

**"when the day of Pentecost was completely filled"**

This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “when the day of Pentecost had come” or, if your language does not speak of days “coming,” “on the day of Pentecost”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 2:1 (#3) (id: 207315)

**"when the day of Pentecost was completely filled"**

Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to use an active form of the verb “fill” in place of the passive form of that verb here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.

**"tongues as if of fire"**

This phrase means “something like tongues of fire,” and a “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire.” (The expression is used with that meaning in [Isaiah 5:24](https://ref.ly/Isa5:24), for example.) This is not a simile. Luke is describing what these objects looked like. Alternate translation: “objects that looked like flames of fire”

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 2:3

## Acts 2:3 (#2) (id: 207325)

**"distributing themselves"**

**"they began to speak in other languages"**

Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that the disciples had been doing something else (speaking in their own languages) but then began to do something new when the Holy Spirit filled them. It might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it may seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express in your language.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. However, it would be preferable to use an equivalent expression that conveys the meaning rather than to say something like “sweet wine has filled them.” Alternate translation: “They have drunk their fill of sweet wine”

Peter **stood** to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles **stood** with him to show their support for him as he spoke. You could indicate that in your translation, perhaps as a separate sentence, if it would be helpful to your readers.

## Acts 2:14 (#9) (id: 207370)

**"let this be known to you"**

The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent (**you**), so you can use an active form with that agent as the implied subject. Alternate translation: “know this”

## Acts 2:17 (#1) (id: 207381)

**""And it will be in the last days,” God says,"**

The material in [2:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:21) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting Joel, and Joel is quoting God. You could avoid having a third\-level quotation by moving the phrase **God says** to before the quotation from Joel. (The phrase itself does not occur in the passage from Joel that Peter quotes. It appears to be something that Peter supplies within the quotation to show that God is the speaker. Since that is the case, putting it before the quotation would not change the actual biblical text.) Alternate translation: “God said, ‘And it will be in the last days, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh’”

**""and your sons and your daughters will prophesy"**

If you have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second\-level quotation, also do that here in the rest of the verse.

**"young men"** \- **"old men"**

God speaks separately of **sons** and **daughters** in this verse and of “male servants” and “female servants” in the next verse. But here the contrast is between **young** and **old**.

## Acts 2:33 (#1) (id: 207485)

**"Therefore"**

Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a result. But it is not the immediate result of what he has just said. He is not saying that Jesus has done what the people see and hear because God raised him from the dead. Instead, this is an overall conclusion. Peter is saying that Jesus sending the Holy Spirit is the reason why the disciples are able to speak in other languages. The crowd should not conclude that they are babbling drunkenly, as some of them have suggested. UST models a way of expressing this sense of the word **Therefore**.

**"let all the house of Israel know"**

## Acts 2:36 (#3) (id: 207501)

**"let all the house of Israel know"**

It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative, since to this point in his speech Peter has been addressing his audience in the second person. Alternate translation: “all you in the house of Israel, know”

## Acts 2:37 (#3) (id: 207505)

**"they were pierced in the heart"**

## Acts 2:37 (#4) (id: 207506)

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 2:37 (#6) (id: 207508)

**"Men, brothers"**

Often in the New Testament, the term **brothers** refers to fellow believers in Jesus, as it does in [1:15](https://ref.ly/Acts1:15). But here, the crowd who does not yet believe in Jesus is addressing Peter and the other apostles with the same affectionate term that Peter used to address them in [2:29](https://ref.ly/Acts2:29). So it seems that what they mean by it is, “fellow believers in the God of Israel.”

Alternate translation: “fellow believers in our God”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 2:37 (#7) (id: 207509)

**"what should we do"**

The people in the crowd are asking about themselves but not the apostles, so use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Acts 2:38 (#1) (id: 207510)

**"Repent"** \- **"each of you be baptized"** \- **"of your sins,"** \- **"you will receive"**

The words **you** and **your** are plural, **you will receive** is a plural verb form, and the implied “you” in the imperative **Repent** is also plural. But the implied “you” in the imperative **be baptized** is singular, since the subject is **each**.

See: Forms of You

* **Associated Articles:** Forms of You (ID: `33317@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 2:38 (#3) (id: 207512)

**"in the name of Jesus Christ"**

Here the **name** of Jesus represents his authority. By being baptized, these believers were acknowledging Jesus’ authority over their lives as their Lord and Savior. Alternate translation: “to express your allegiance to Jesus Christ as your Lord”

## Acts 2:39 (#1) (id: 207514)

**"the promise is"**

Peter is speaking of the Holy Spirit by association with the way God promised to send the Holy Spirit, as Peter says specifically in [2:33](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33). Alternate translation: “God has promised the Holy Spirit”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 2:39 (#2) (id: 207515)

**"to you and to your children"**

Peter showed the people in [2:17](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17) that God’s promise through Joel to pour out his Spirit included their “sons” and “daughters.” So the implication could be that the people in the crowd should not think that any of them have to reach a certain age before professing faith in Jesus and being baptized. Alternate translation: “to all of you, no matter what your age,” or see the next note for a further possibility.

## Acts 2:39 (#3) (id: 207516)

**"to you and to your children"**

Peter could also be using the word **children** in a figurative sense to mean “descendants.” In that case, he would be saying that faith in Jesus as the Messiah was not something just for the people living at this time, but also for people living at all times in the future. That would parallel what he says next about faith in Jesus not being just for those who are present in this place, but for people living in all places. Alternate translation: “to you and your descendants” or “to you and everyone who will live after you”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 2:39 (#4) (id: 207517)

**"to all those {being} at a distance"**

Since Peter is speaking to Jews as a fellow Jew, this is likely an implicit reference to the Jews who were living in other parts of the Roman Empire. However, this statement took on greater meaning when the church realized that “God has also given repentance unto life to the Gentiles,” as its leaders say in [11:18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:18). So you could either express the likely initial meaning here in your translation, or you could leave the statement more general. Alternate translation: “to the Jews living in faraway parts of the empire”

Here Luke is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **urged** tells in what way Peter **testified** further about faith in Jesus.

## Acts 3:22 (#2) (id: 207633)

**"The Lord our God"**

Some ancient manuscripts read “the Lord our God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 somewhat loosely but with the same basic meaning. ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the Lord your God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 exactly. Still other ancient manuscripts read simply “the Lord God.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

**"all the prophets"**

Here the phrase **all the prophets** is probably not the same kind of generalization that it seems to be in [3:18](https://ref.ly/Acts3:18). It is true in a more literal sense that all the prophets **announced these days**. There was something in the messages of each one of them that pointed to the culmination of God’s work in the coming of Jesus. So even if your language does not use generalizations for emphasis, you could translate these words just as Peter says them.

**"in your seed"**

As the apostle Paul notes in [Galatians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gal3:16), God used the singular form of the word **seed** when he said this to Abraham, and so the ultimate fulfillment of this promise came when God sent Jesus as the Savior for everyone in the world who would believe in him. That may also be what Peter has in view here, since he refers in the next verse to God’s “Servant,” meaning the Messiah. Alternate translation: “through the Messiah, who will be your descendant”

## Acts 4:3 (#5) (id: 207673)

**"since it was already evening"**

The implication is that the ruling council, which Luke describes in [4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Acts4:5-Acts4:6), would not meet to question anyone at night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “since it was already evening and the council would not meet to question them at night”

## Acts 4:4 (#1) (id: 207674)

**"But"**

Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened after this much of the story as a result of the events within the story itself. This is not the end of the whole story, but it is the end of a significant part of it. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a story.

**"the number of the men"**

Luke is not using the word **men** in a generic sense here. The figure of 5,000 is the number of the men alone. It does not include women and children. So it would not be accurate to translate **men** as “people.” Instead, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this distinction explicitly. Alternate translation: “the number of the men alone, not counting the women and children,”

**"became about 5,000"**

The word translated **became** could mean: (1\) the community of believers in Jesus grew to a total of 5,000 as a result of the professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “in the community of believers grew to about 5,000” (2\) “was,” and that would indicate that 5,000 men made professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “who put their faith in Jesus that day was about 5,000”

Luke is implicitly describing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which consisted of these three groups of people. Luke describes this council explicitly as “the Sanhedrin” in [4:15](https://ref.ly/Acts4:15). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it by name here.

## Acts 4:6 (#1) (id: 207682)

**"Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas"**

Luke describes Annas as **the high priest**, but the actual situation was complicated. At this time the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea. One Roman official had appointed Annas some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son\-in\-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. If you decide to clarify this for your readers, it would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible. Alternate translation: “Annas, whom the Jews recognized as the high priest, and Caiaphas, whom a Roman official had appointed as the high priest”

The words **power** and **name** (meaning authority; see next note) mean similar things. The council members may be using them together to ask a comprehensive or emphatic question.

**"Rulers of the people and elders"**

Peter is addressing the entire council by referring to its two components. Some of the members had ruling responsibilities. Others, the **elders**, were added to the council to bring its total membership up to 70, since according to [Exodus 24:1](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1), that was the number of elders who accompanied Moses when God confirmed the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai.

## Acts 4:9 (#1) (id: 207693)

**"if we are being questioned today concerning a good deed to a sick man, by what means he was made well"**

Peter is not suggesting seriously that the subject of the questioning is uncertain. He knows the subject, but he is suggesting ironically that it is uncertain so that he can describe it from his own perspective. The council asked by what power or authority he and John did “this,” implying that “this” was something bad, a public disturbance that troubled the authorities. In response, Peter asserts that “this” was instead something good, **a good deed to a sick man**. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could indicate the meaning that Peter is communicating through this irony.

**"let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel"**

The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject.

## Acts 4:11 (#2) (id: 207705)

**"the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner"**

Peter is quoting from [Psalm 118:22](https://ref.ly/Ps118:22), and the quotation contains a metaphor. This psalm is describing the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non\-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.

The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building”

**"there is no salvation in anyone else"**

In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there is no salvation in no one else.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning.

**"What should we do to these men"**

This could mean: (1\) the Jewish leaders were using the question form to express their frustration because they realize that they cannot punish Peter and John. As [4:21](https://ref.ly/Acts4:21) indicates explicitly, and as the leaders suggest here, they are afraid of how the people might respond if they do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is very difficult to know what we should do to these men!” (2\) the leaders were asking one another a genuine question, because ultimately they do decide to do something to Peter and John. They warn them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus, with an implied threat of punishment if they do. In that case it would be accurate to translate this as a question.

By **it**, the council members do not mean the news of the man’s healing, since they have already said that everyone in Jerusalem knows about it. They mean the teaching that Jesus is Messiah, since they then try to prevent this from spreading by not allowing the apostles to speak to anyone about Jesus.

In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “no longer to speak in this name to none of men.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively.

**"Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

The implications are that Ananias was not obligated to give all of the money to the apostles. He was free to keep some if he wished or if he needed it. He could simply have acknowledged that he was doing that, and giving the rest of the money would still have been a generous act because there was no compulsion.

Ananaias actually has **lied to men**, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of his act. As in the previous verse, where Peter says that Ananias has lied to the Holy Spirit, here he means that Ananias has lied to the apostles and other believers, and God is present in them.

## Acts 5:8 (#2) (id: 207862)

**"How {is it} that it was agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord"**

Peter is using the question form to rebuke Sapphira. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!”

**"by you"** \- **"your"** \- **"you"**

The word **you** in its first instance refers to two people, Ananias and Sapphira, so it would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. The word **your** and the word **you** in its second instance refer only to Sapphira, so those words are singular.

## Acts 5:9 (#4) (id: 207867)

**"to test the Spirit of the Lord"**

Here the word **test** means to challenge. Ananias and Sapphira were trying to see if they could get away with lying about how much they received for the land they sold. Alternate translation: “to challenge the Spirit of the Lord”

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 5:9

## Acts 5:9 (#5) (id: 207868)

**"to test the Spirit of the Lord"**

Ananias and Sapphira actually tested or challenged the apostles, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of their act, as he does similarly in [5:3](https://ref.ly/Acts5:3) and [5:4](https://ref.ly/Acts5:4). Since the Spirit of the Lord was present in the apostles, by challenging them, Ananias and Sapphira effectively lied to the Spirit.

**"the feet of the ones having buried your husband {are} at the door"**

Peter is referring to the return of the young men who buried Ananaias. Their **feet** represent them by association with the way they are using their feet to walk back. The **door** represents their return by association with the way they will come through the door when they return.

The implications are that Sapphira is also going to die and that the same young men will **carry** her **out** to bury her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are also going to die as a judgment from God, and those same young men are going to carry you out and bury you”

**"she fell down at his feet and expired"**

Sapphira fell down because she died. She did not die because she fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that she died and then that she fell. Alternate translation: “she died and fell down at his feet”

**"she fell down at his feet"**

This means that she fell to the ground in front of Peter. This expression should not be confused with the idea of “falling down at a person’s feet,” that is, bowing down to the ground in front of someone as a sign of humility. Alternate translation: “she collapsed onto the ground in front of him”

**"dared to join them"**

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why no unbelievers **dared to join them**. The reason seems to be that the Jewish leaders had commanded the apostles not to speak or teach about Jesus ([4:18](https://ref.ly/Acts4:18)), but they were still doing that. Later in this chapter, in [5:28](https://ref.ly/Acts5:28), the Sanhedrin indicates that it has arrested the apostles for violating that command.

## Acts 5:15 (#1) (id: 207890)

**"so that"**

Luke says **so that** to introduce a result, but it is not the direct result of what he said just before, that many men and women became part of the church. It is the result of what he said in [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12), that the apostles were doing “many signs and wonders.” All of [5:12–15](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12-Acts5:15) could be understood as a single sentence, and in that case what Luke says here would more clearly follow logically and grammatically from what he says in [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12). However, ULT divides the material into several sentences, which is another way in which it can be understood. UST models a way to show how what Luke says here introduces a result of what he said in [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12) about the “signs and wonders” that the apostles were doing.

## Acts 5:15 (#3) (id: 207892)

**"the sick"**

Luke is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who were sick”

**"cots and mats"**

The words **cots** and **mats** mean similar things. Luke could be using them together for emphasis, although he could also be describing two different ways that people managed to make their sick relatives and friends reasonably comfortable as they waited in the streets for Peter to walk by.

**"his} shadow might overshadow any one of them"**

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Acts 5:16 (#4) (id: 207899)

**"who were all healed"**

It does not appear that **all** is a generalization for emphasis in this case. So it would not be accurate to treat **all** as figurative and say something like “and large numbers of them were healed.” Luke is describing what remarkable things God did through the apostles at this time, and he does seem to mean that every sick person whom the people brought to Jerusalem was healed. So it would be appropriate to say in your translation just what ULT says here.

The phrase **all those with him** means specifically all the other priests who joined the high priest in taking action against the apostles. Luke observes here that those other priests were from the group known as the **Sadducees**. As a note to [4:1](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1) explains, they opposed the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection.

The first instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles, but the second instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the captain and the officers. The captain and officers were not afraid that the people would stone the apostles. They were afraid that they would be stoned themselves if they used violence against the apostles. You could reword this to make the referents clear. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “Then the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles back. But the captain and officers did not use any violence, because they were afraid that the people would stone them if they did”

Luke speaks generally of **the faith** (that is, belief in Jesus) to indicate that these priests **became obedient** to one part of it, Jesus’ teachings about how to live. But that obedience showed that the priests genuinely embraced faith in Jesus as Messiah in its entirety. Alternate translation: “came to believe in Jesus and so started obeying his teachings”

The word **instigated** means that Stephen’s opponents in some way persuaded these men to lie about what Stephen was saying. They may have offered them money, or they may have convinced them that Stephen was a dangerous person who needed to be stopped. Since Luke does not specify the means, it may be best not to suggest a means in your translation. But it would be appropriate to indicate that what these men were recruited to say about Stephen was a lie. Alternate translation: “recruited some men to lie about Stephen by saying”

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not be hurting each other!”

**"Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us"**

The man is using a rhetorical question to emphasize the truth of what he is saying.

**"a ruler and a judge"**

In this context, the words **ruler** and **judge** mean basically the same thing. The man is using repetition to emphasize the fact that he feels that Moses has no authority over them. If your language does not use repetition for such a purpose, you could use a single phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “an authority with power”

## Acts 7:28 (#1) (id: 208164)

**"You do not want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you"**

The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **do you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday”

The man is using a rhetorical question implicitly to threaten Moses by indicating that he and probably others knew that Moses had killed the Egyptian. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

**"40 years having been filled"**

Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.

**"Untie the sandal of your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground"**

In this culture, removing footwear was a symbolic way of acknowledging that a place was sacred. Footwear that had been worn elsewhere should not touch it.

## Acts 7:34 (#2) (id: 208184)

**"I have certainly seen"**

Stephen is reproducing a Hebrew idiom from the biblical account of Moses at the burning bush. The verb **seen** is repeated in Hebrew. This repetition expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having seen how his people were being oppressed. This Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language.

**""You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me"**

The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement.

**""You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me"**

Speaking through the prophet Amos, God used the question form to emphasize to the people of **Israel** that they did not really worship Him **in the wilderness** with their sacrifices. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

**"You did not offer"** \- **"did you"**

**You** is plural in these instances, even though the addressee (**house**) is singular, because God is actually speaking to all of the Israelites. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in such a case, you could use singular **you** in your translation.

**And** at the beginning of this verse introduces God’s own answer to the question he asked in the previous verse, [7:42](https://ref.ly/Acts7:42): “You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me … , did you?” The answer is in contrast to what the question asks.

**"you took up"** \- **"I will remove you"**

The term **took up** indicates that the Israelites carried the idols this verse describes around with them as they traveled in the wilderness. The term **remove** in this context means that God will send them into exile as a punishment, with the sense of carrying them away from their homeland. So the punishment is ironic; if possible, use similar terms in your language that will bring out this irony. Alternate translation: “you carried around … I will carry you away”

As in [7:42](https://ref.ly/Acts7:42), **you** is plural here, even though the addressee (“house”) is singular, since God is speaking to all of the Israelites. In this verse **your** is also plural.

## Acts 7:51 (#1) (id: 208277)

Stephen is using the exclamatory word **O** to make a transition in his speech. Up to this point, he has been identifying with the Sanhedrin members, saying “our fathers” as he describes what earlier generations of Israelites did. Now, as he shifts to rebuking them, he addresses them with the vocative **O**. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for this same purpose.

## Acts 8:7 (#1) (id: 208345)

**"For many of those having unclean spirits, shouting with a loud voice, they were coming out"**

As Luke tells the story of this event, he changes from the people who had **unclean spirits** being the subject of the sentence to the **unclean spirits** themselves being the subject. This may be because the unclean spirits controlled people to such an extent that the spirits seemed to be the people themselves. It may be helpful to your readers to put the information about the spirits before the information about the people who had them.

**"many"** \- **"paralyzed and lame were healed"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it would be appropriate to say Jesus, since the book of Acts shows that the apostles healed people in the name of Jesus, for example, in [4:10](https://ref.ly/Acts4:10).

The word that ULT translates as **works** here is the same word that it translates as “power” in [8:10](https://ref.ly/Acts8:10). It can mean either power or works that demonstrate power. Luke is using the word to show what an ironic situation Simon is in. He claimed to be “the power … that is called Great,” but now he recognizes that **works** of power that are truly **great** are done in the name of Jesus.

It means to put someone on trial, and the implications, based on the fact that Herod saw that it pleased the Jewish leaders when he executed James, are that Herod planned to execute Peter after this trial. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to put Peter on trial and then execute him”

**"having become worm\-eaten, he died"**

The word translated **worm\-eaten** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The word **worm\-eaten** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here.

Alternate translation: “he died after his wound became so infected that it was infested with maggots” (2\) that the word **struck** is figurative and it refers to an illness, a severe case of intestinal worms.

## Acts 13:1 (#6) (id: 208952)

**"the foster brother"**

In this culture, rulers would sometimes bring the children of other parents into their homes to be raised and educated with their own children. This gave their children playmates and friends, and it was also a way of honoring or thanking the parents of the other children. A boy who was raised with the son of a ruler would be considered the **foster brother** of that son. There may be a similar role in your culture, and your language may have a term for it that you can use in your translation. You could also explain the meaning of the term “foster brother,” as UST does. Alternate translation: “the childhood playmate” or “the boyhood friend”

In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. **Herod the tetrarch** ruled over Galilee, one of four areas that the kingdom of his father, Herod the Great, was divided into after his death. (The Herod described in Chapter 12 was a different man, the grandson of Herod the Great and the nephew of Herod the tetrarch.)

Jews in the time of the New Testament used the expression **fearing God** to describe Gentiles (non\-Jews) who worshiped the God of Israel and attended the synagogue. That is what Paul means here.

## Acts 13:18 (#1) (id: 209020)

**"he endured them"**

This means “he put up with their disobedience.” Some ancient copies have a different word that means “he took care of them,” which makes sense, since in this part of his speech, Paul is listing all of the good things that God did for the Israelites. Paul would be quoting Deuteronomy 1:13 from a well\-known Greek translation. If the reading **put up with them** is correct, Paul may be foreshadowing the warning he gives at the end of his speech in [13:40–41](https://ref.ly/Acts13:40-Acts13:41). If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation.

Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it might be good to present this quotation from John the Baptist as a direct quotation if possible, since it uses several figures of speech that might not sound natural in an indirect quotation. (As an indirect quotation, this would read something like this: “he asked the people who they thought him to be, and he told them he was not he and that behold, one was coming after him, the sandals of whose feet he was not worthy to untie.”) You may be able to indicate the beginning of Paul’s quotation from John with some punctuation or convention that your language uses.

## Acts 13:33 (#3) (id: 209074)

**"for our children"**

Some ancient copies read, “for us, their children” which makes sense, since Paul is saying that this promise was fulfilled in his own generation, not in the next generation. If the reading **for our children** is correct, Paul may mean “for the children of us Israelites.” If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT and UST.

## Acts 13:33 (#9) (id: 209080)

**"You are my Son; today I have fathered you"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

**""I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles,"**

This quotation is from the prophet Isaiah. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Messiah directly in it. (Paul and Barnabas are saying that since they are disciples of the Messiah, the quotation also refers to their ministry.) You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second\-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language could use to indicate the start of a second\-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does.

**"why are you testing God"**

**"****I will rebuild the fallen tent of David, and I will rebuild its ruins and restore it****"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

## Acts 15:19 (#2) (id: 209316)

**"turning to God"**

James is speaking of these Gentiles as if they are physically **turning** to God. He means that they are believing in the true God and starting to live in a way that pleases him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly. Alternate translation: “believing in God and obeying him”

## Acts 15:20 (#1) (id: 209317)

**""**

James lists four regulations in this verse and he gives the reason for them in the next verse. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 19–21\. It might say something like this: “Therefore, I judge that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God. However, since Moses has had those proclaiming him in every city from ancient generations—he is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath—we should write to the Gentiles to abstain from the pollution of idols and sexual immorality and strangled things and blood.”

## Acts 15:20 (#5) (id: 209321)

**"the strangled and blood"**

God did not allow the Jews to consume blood in any form. Therefore, for one thing, they could not eat the meat from an animal that had been **strangled**, because the blood would not have been properly drained from the body of the animal. For another thing, while James is not saying that the Gentiles should have no contact at all with blood, he is saying implicitly that they should not consume blood. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “from eating the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation, because this meat still contains blood, and from consuming blood”

## Acts 15:21 (#1) (id: 209324)

**"For Moses has by city, from ancient generations, ones proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath"**

James is saying implicitly that Gentile believers should observe at least the four regulations he has listed because they embody essential aspects of the law of Moses (not worshiping idols, not practicing sexual immorality, and respecting the blood of sacrifices), and the law of Moses is well known because it is read aloud regularly in the Jewish synagogues. If the Gentiles did not observe even these regulations, that would upset Jewish believers and make Jews who were not yet believers more hostile to Christianity. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand what James is saying. UST models one way to do this.

**"Judas called Barsabbas"**

The words **Judas** and **Barsabbas** are the names of men. **Barsabbas** was another name by which **Judas** was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does.

## Acts 16:37 (#9) (id: 209496)

**"let them lead us out"**

It is likely that Paul wanted the magistrates to bring him and Silas out of prison, which would effectively be an apology for mistreatment, so that the believers in Philippi would have the protection of the law even after Paul and his companions left the city. However, this is more a matter of interpretation than of implied information, so it would probably be best not to put an explanation of it in your translation. You can leave it to teachers and preachers of the Bible to explain.

You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they were terrified when they heard that they were Roman citizens, because as magistrates they were supposed to make sure that citizens were not tortured and received fair trials, and they were concerned that more important authorities would punish them for the way they had treated Paul and Silas”

## Acts 17:18 (#2) (id: 209554)

**"of the Epicurean"** \- **"philosophers"**

The word **Epicurean** is the name of a certain kind of philosopher. Epicureans believed that all things were formed by chance and that the gods were too busy being happy to be bothered with governing the universe. They rejected the resurrection and wanted only simple pleasures.

**"Stoic"**

The word **Stoic** is the name of another kind of philosopher. Stoics believed that freedom comes from resigning oneself to fate. They rejected a personal, loving God and the resurrection.

## Acts 17:18 (#4) (id: 209556)

**"word\-picker"**

These Athenian philosophers are using a common expression in their culture that refers negatively to a person who only knows little bits of information. The expression depicts a person picking up words or ideas the way a bird picks up seeds. The philosophers are saying that Paul has only a few bits of information that are not worth listening to. Alternate translation: “uneducated person”

**"of foreign gods"**

Luke assumes that his readers will understand that the Athenian philosphers misunderstood Paul and thought that he was introducing two new **gods** that the Greeks and Romans had not known about before, Jesus and Anastasis (the Greek word for resurrection). You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “of two new gods, Jesus and Anastasis”

**"Areopagus"**

The word **Areopagus** means “Hill of Ares” in Greek. It was named after the pagan god whose name was Ares in Greek and Mars in Latin. Luke does not explain the meaning of this word, since his readers already understand Greek. ULT spells this name the way it sounds in English. In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language. You could also translate the meaning of the word and use the name “Mars Hill,” as UST does. Or you could spell the word the way it sounds and then explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “Mars Hill” or “the Areopagus, that is, Mars Hill”

**"to the Areopagus"**

Luke most likely means that the philosophers from the marketplace brought Paul to meet the main group of philosophers on the Areopagus, not that they just brought Paul to the hill itself. Luke would be using the word **Areopagus** by association to mean the philosophers who gathered there. Alternate translation: “to the philosophers who met on the Areopagus”

**"Are we able to know what this new teaching {is} that is being spoken by you"**

This is not actually a rhetorical question, since the philosophers really do want to know whether Paul is willing to explain himself more fully to the group at the Areopagus. However, if in your language it might seem to be a rhetorical question, you could translate it as a statement instead.

## Acts 18:17 (#2) (id: 209676)

**"the synagogue leader"**

Since Luke says in [18:8](https://ref.ly/Acts18:8) that Crispus was the synagogue leader in Corinth, the implication is that during the year and a half that had passed since then, another man, Sosthenes, had become the leader. Since the Jewish leaders who were hostile to Paul were also hostile to him, a further implication is that, like Crispus, Sosthenes had become a believer in Jesus. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. (However, see next note for another possibility that some interpreters favor.) Alternate translation: “the new synagogue leader, who believed in Jesus”

**"But having seized Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, they were all beating him before the judgment seat"**

This could mean: (1\) that the Jewish leaders were beating Sosthenes because he was a believer in Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders were all beating him” (2\) that the Gentiles who were present in the court beat Sosthenes because the Jews had caused trouble by bothering Gallio with an insignificant matter and Sosthenes was the synagogue leader.

## Acts 18:18 (#1) (id: 209679)

**"But Paul, having stayed yet many days"**

Luke is using the word **But** here to introduce a contrast between what Paul might have been expected to do—leave the city because he was in danger and to protect the believers from danger themselves, as he did in Thessalonica and Berea—and what Paul actually did—remain in the city. In your translation, indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, Paul stayed yet many days, then”

**"a vow"**

This **vow** was a promise that a person in this culture made to God that he would not drink alcohol or cut his hair until the end of a set period of time. A person might do this to express his sincerity about something he was praying for, to acknowledge something that God had done for him, or to consecrate himself to deeper devotion to God for a time.

(Within the temple of Artemis was an image of the goddess. It had been fashioned from a meteorite that had fallen from the sky. The people of Ephesus thought that this rock had come directly from Zeus, whom they considered the ruler of their pagan gods.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

In this verse, the city clerk is giving the reason why the people of Ephesus should not harm Gaius and Aristarchus impulsively. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 36–37\. It might say something like this: “You brought these two men here even though they are neither temple\-robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. Therefore it is necessary for you to be calmed and to do nothing rash, since it is undeniable that people from throughout the world come to Ephesus to worship Artemis.”

## Acts 21:23 (#3) (id: 210030)

**"from themselves"**

Some ancient manuscripts read **from themselves.** That would be indicating that these men made the vow on their own initiative. ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “upon themselves.” That would be indicating that the men still needed to fulfill the commitment implicit in the vow to make an offering in the temple at the end of the time during which the conditions of the vow were in effect. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

**""**

In this verse, Luke is giving the reason why the Jews from the province of Asia thought that Paul had “defiled” the temple area by bringing “Greeks” into it. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 28–29\. It might say something like this: “Now some Jews from Asia had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with Paul in the city. When they saw Paul in the temple when the seven days were about to be finished, they were thinking that Paul had brought Trophimus into the temple. So they were agitating the whole crowd, and they laid their hands on him, shouting, ‘Men, Israelites, help! This is the man teaching all everywhere against the people and the law and this place. And he has even both brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.’”

The commander is using the question form to emphasize the conclusion he has drawn about Paul.

**"I am not persuaded at all that any of these things eludes him"**

In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “I am not persuaded that not any of these things eludes him.” In Greek, the second negative creates a positive meaning by canceling the first negative.

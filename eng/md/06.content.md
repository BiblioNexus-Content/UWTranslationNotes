### What is the book of Joshua about?

The book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering and occupying the land of Canaan. Joshua was the leader who replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought against the people groups that had been living in Canaan. This book then tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: Promised Land)

### Who wrote the book of Joshua?

The book does not tell us who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times the Jewish people have thought that Joshua recorded much of what is in this book.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

This book has traditionally had the title “Joshua” because it tells how Joshua led the people of Israel. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests that Joshua was the writer of the book, as it is not certain how much of it he may have written.

### When should Joshua be translated?

The book of Joshua should probably be translated after Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events described in the book of Joshua may be more difficult to understand without the information in those previous books.

Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book
----------------------------------------------------

### The term “devoted”

The book uses a term in chapters 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 22 that the ULT translates as “devoted.” This was a specialized term that described the cultural practice of giving something over to Yahweh so that humans would no longer be able to use it. Depending on the context, the term can indicate either “destroy” or “preserve, but set apart.” The context must determine the meaning, so be sensitive to the context as you translate this term.

Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book
---------------------------------------

### “struck,” “struck to the mouth of the sword,” “to the mouth of the sword”

The author often uses the expression “to the mouth of the sword” in connection with the term “devoted.” It was a common expression of his culture that referred to destroying something completely. When it appears, as it does about a dozen times in the book, it helps clarify what the term “devoted” means in a specific context. (See: Idiom)

In many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, king, or kings, as if they had only hit them. But he means that they attacked those opponents, and in some contexts the meaning is clearly that they killed them. (See: Metonymy)

In several contexts the author uses a longer form of this expression and says Joshua and his soldiers “struck them (or it) to the mouth of the sword.” This means that they completely destroyed a city, killing everyone who lived there. For example, speaking in 11:11 of what Joshua and his army did to the inhabitants of the city of Hazor, the author says that “they struck every soul that was in it (the city of Hazor) to the mouth of the sword.” (See: Idiom)

### “And it happened”

The author often uses the phrase “And it happened” to introduce a new event in the story or a new development within an episode. To translate this phrase in its various occurrences, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event or development. (See: Introduction of a New Event)

### “unto this day”

The author used this phrase to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time that is already past. He must avoid giving the impression to his readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to use an equivalent phrase such as “at the time of this writing.” This phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9, 5:9, 6:25, 7:26, 8:28, 29, 10:27, 13:13, 14:14, 15:63, and 16:10\.

### “And now”

Characters in the story who are making a speech or delivering a message often use the phrase “And now” to introduce their main point. That point typically relates to what they want their listeners to do in response to what they have said so far. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. For example, you might say something such as “now here is my main point” or “now here is what I want you to do.” This phrase occurs in Joshua 1:2, 2:12, 3:12, 9:6, 9:11, 9:12, 9:23, 9:25, 13:7, 14:10, 14:12, 22:4, 24:14, and 24:23\.

### “hear” and “listen”

The author and characters sometimes use the words “hear” and “listen” in a specialized sense to mean someone complying with what they have heard or listened to someone saying. When these words refer to a person, they have the sense of “obey.” When they apply to God, they indicate that God did what someone asked him to do, so you might say that God “answered” that person’s prayer. At other times, these words have a more literal sense of sound registering in the ears, that is, of a person taking in and understanding information. Be sensitive to the meaning of these words in the context as you translate them.

### The name of tribe or nation representing its people or army

The author and characters often use the name of a nation or Israelite tribe to mean its people or its army. It may sound as if an individual with that name is doing an action, but it is actually a group of people descended from that individual. Once you are aware of this usage, the meaning should be evident from the context. (See: Metonymy)

### “the sons of”

Similarly, the author and characters often use the expression “the sons of” to mean the people or army of a nation or Israelite tribe descended from the individual who is then named. They do not mean only the literal, first\-generation male descendants of that person. Once you are aware of this usage, the meaning should be evident from the context. (See: Metaphor)

### “to the face of”

The author and characters often use the expression “to the face of” to mean “before,” “in front of,” or “in the presence of” a person or thing. This is by association with the way one can see the face of a person who is present and the way people typically face forward, toward what is before or in front of them. This usage occurs very frequently in the book, about 60 times, and accounts for almost every instance of the word “face.” Only in 5:14 and 7:6 does the word refer literally to part of the body, where Joshua bows down with his face to the ground. (See: Metonymy)

### “from your faces”

In the phrase “from your faces” in 2:11 and 23:3 the word “from” introduces the cause of the action. In 2:11 it introduces the cause of the the inhabitants of Jericho’s fear and in 23:3 it introduces the cause of Yahweh’s action. In these two passages the word “faces” represents the Israelite people themselves, in their entirety. See the synecdoche note for the phrase “from your faces” in these two passages for more information. (See: Synecdoche)

### “all of Israel”

This phrase appears sixteen times in the book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every single person in the nation of Israel. Often it means the Israelite army. At other times it refers to representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel. However, in a few contexts it does seem to indicate every Israelite, as when Yahweh tells Joshua in 3:7, “This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all of Israel, who will know that just as I was with Moses, I am with you.” (See: Hyperbole)

### “shall”

The ULT represents the Hebrew instructional verb form with the English helping verb “shall.” For example, when Deborah tells Barak in Judges 4:6 “and you shall take with you 10,000 men,” she is instructing him to take 10,000 men with him. Other ways to say this are: “you are to take 10,000 men with you” or “take 10,000 men with you.” Translate this form with the most natural way in your language for giving instructions. (See: Irregular Use of Tenses)

Part 4: Specific Translation Issues in Chapters 13–21
-----------------------------------------------------

There are some specific translation issues in the section of the book that describes the territories of the Israelite tribes and their borders.

### “inheritance”

The author uses the idea of “inheritance” by association to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. (See: Metonymy)

### “went up,” “went down”

In Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. Such expressions occur frequently in the descriptions of tribal borders. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate such expressions more simply. For example, you could just say “went” instead of “went up” or “went down.” (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### “from” a direction “to” a place

The author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. For example, speaking of the territory of Naphtali, he describes the territory of Asher as being “from the west” relative to it, meaning that someone would be coming from the west to go from Asher to Naphtali. In your translation, express this in the way that your culture describes the relative location of places. For example, you might say instead that Asher was “to the west” of Naphtali. (See: Idiom)

### “the sea”

When the author says “the sea,” he means the Mediterranean Sea. He calls it the Great Sea when he gives it a name. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### “seaward”

The author uses the term **seaward** by association to mean toward the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, to the west. (See: Metonymy)

### “toward the sunrise,” “from the sunrise”

The author uses the term **sunrise** by association to mean the direction where the sun rises, that is, the east. (See: Metonymy)

### Names in border descriptions

All names in border descriptions are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST. (See: How to Translate Names)

## Joshua - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 775812)

Joshua 1 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes the Israelites’ preparations for the conquest of the land of Canaan.

* Yahweh encourages Joshua (1:1–9\)
* The eastern tribes send their armies (1:10–16\)

At the start of the book of Joshua, the biblical narrative continues naturally from the end of the book of Deuteronomy.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “Be strong and courageous”

Yahweh tells Joshua in verses 6, 7, and 9 to “be strong and courageous,” and the leaders of the eastern tribes tell him the same thing in verse 18\. The words “strong” and “courageous” mean similar things. Yahweh and the tribal leaders are using the two terms together for emphasis. Joshua needs to act with great courage, but if he does, Yahweh will give him victory and honor him. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single word or phrase, but you should translate this expression the same way each time so that your readers will recognize its importance in this part of the story. (See: Doublet)

### “you” and “your”

The words “you” and “your” are plural in vv. 2–3 because Yahweh is speaking about the Israelites. They are singular in vv. 2–9 because Yahweh is speaking to Joshua. They are plural in vv. 11–15 because groups are being addressed. They are singular in vv. 16–18 because the tribal leaders are speaking to Joshua.

## Joshua 1:1 (#1) (id: 775813)

**"Now it happened"**

As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, the author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

See: Introduction of a New Event

## Joshua 1:2 (#1) (id: 775815)

**"And now"**

As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, the phrase translated as **And now** is an expression that people of this time used to introduce the main point of a message. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation, here and for the other instances of this expression in the book. Alternate translation: \[So here is what I want you to do:]

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Connecting Words and Phrases (ID: `33335@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:2 (#2) (id: 775816)

**"arise"**

Yahweh is using the expression **arise** to tell Joshua to take action and lead the Israelites across the Jordan River to begin the conquest of Canaan. He is not telling him to get out of bed or stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: \[get going]

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:2 (#3) (id: 775817)

**"to them, to the sons of Israel"**

Since Joshua is one of the **sons of Israel**, Yahweh is referring to him in the third person when he says **them**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could have Yahweh refer to him in the second person. This would indicate explicitly that Joshua is included in this promise. Alternate translation: \[to you and the rest of the sons of Israel] or \[to you and all of the other people of Israel]

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:2 (#4) (id: 775818)

**"to the sons of Israel"**

As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and in many places throughout the book, **sons** means “descendants,” so the phrase **sons of** is describing a people group. Alternate translation: \[to the people of Israel]

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:3 (#1) (id: 775819)

**"Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon"**

Yahweh is using part of each of the Israelites, **the sole of your foot**, to represent the people of Israel themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[Every place that you will tread upon]

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:3 (#2) (id: 775820)

**"your foot"** \- **"to you"**

Here, the words **your** and **you** are plural and refer to Joshua and all the other Israelite people. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form of **foot** and to indicate specifically that **you** is plural. Alternate translation: \[your feet … to all of you]

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:3 (#3) (id: 775821)

**"I have given it to you"**

Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: \[I will give it to you] or \[I will certainly give it to you]

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: `33391@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:4 (#3) (id: 775824)

**"from the going of the sun"**

Yahweh is using **the going of the sun**, that is, the sunset, by association to mean “the west,” since the sun sets in the west. Alternate translation: \[in the west]

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:4 (#4) (id: 775825)

**"your territory"**

Here, the word **your** is plural and refers to the tribes of Israel and includes Joshua. Alternate translation: \[the territory of you Israelites]

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:5 (#1) (id: 775826)

**"No man"**

Since the book of Joshua describes how the kings of cities and kingdoms led their soldiers into battle to oppose Joshua, the phrase **No man** seems implicitly to mean “No king and his army” or more broadly “No people group.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: \[No king and his army] or \[No people group]

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:5 (#2) (id: 775827)

**"will {be able to} stand to your face"**

In this context, the word **stand** means “resist” or “withstand.” You could indicate this meaning explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[will be able to resist to your face] or \[will be able to resist you]

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:5 (#3) (id: 775828)

**"will {be able to} stand to your face"**

In this context the phrase **to your face** either means “in front of you,” with **face** meaning by association the area in front of Joshua, or “against you,” with part of Joshua, his **face**, representing all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: \[will be able to stand against you] or \[will be able to resist you]

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:5 (#4) (id: 775829)

**"to your face"** \- **"your life"** \- **"with you"** \- **"I will"** \- **"abandon you"** \- **"I will"** \- **"leave you"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words **you** and **your** are singular in this verse and through verse 9, since they refer to Joshua. So use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:5 (#5) (id: 775830)

**"I will not abandon you and I will not leave you"**

The phrases **I will not abandon you** and **I will not leave you** mean the same thing. Yahweh says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize to Joshua that he will be with him. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: \[I will not ever abandon you] or \[I will certainly stay with you always]

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:5 (#6) (id: 775831)

**"I will not abandon you and I will not leave you"**

If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate these two double negatives that consist of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **abandon** and **leave**. Alternate translation: \[I will always be with you and help you]

See: Double Negatives

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Double Negatives (ID: `33265@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:6 (#1) (id: 775832)

**"Be strong and be courageous"**

The phrases **Be strong** and **be courageous** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[Be very courageous]

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:6 (#2) (id: 775833)

**"to their fathers"**

Here, **fathers** means “ancestors” and refers specifically to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[to their forefathers] or \[to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:7 (#1) (id: 775834)

**"be strong and be very courageous"**

These are the same two phrases that occurred in the previous verse, except the word **very** is added here for increased emphasis. See how you translated the phrase “Be strong and be courageous” in the previous verse and consider how you might add even more emphasis here. Alternate translation: \[Be entirely courageous]

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:7 (#2) (id: 775835)

**"Do not turn aside from it {to} the right or {to} the left"**

Yahweh is speaking as if **the law that Moses … commanded** were literally a road that Joshua was walking on and as if Joshua might **turn aside from** it and walk on a different path. He means that Joshua must not stop living in the manner in which God commanded in the law. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[Do not stop obeying it]

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:7 (#3) (id: 775836)

**"to} the right or {to} the left"**

Yahweh is speaking of two things in order to mean those things and everything in between them. Continuing the image of the road, he means that Joshua should not go off the road in any direction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: \[in any way]

* **Associated Articles:** Merism (ID: `33291@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:8 (#1) (id: 775837)

**"This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth"**

Yahweh is using the phrase **shall not depart from your mouth** by association to mean that Joshua must continually read the **book of the law**, since people at this time read out loud, even when reading alone, so Joshua would use his mouth to form the words as he read. (However, this is not a command to read only alone. It envisions that Joshua might at times read the law aloud to the people of Israel.) Alternate translation: \[You shall not stop reading this book of the law]

## Joshua 1:8 (#2) (id: 775838)

**"day and night"**

Yahweh is referring to the two main components of time, **day** and **night**, to mean “all the time.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: \[continually]

## Joshua 1:8 (#3) (id: 775839)

**"you will make your ways prosperous and then you will succeed"**

The phrases **you will make your ways prosperous** and **you will succeed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[you will assuredly be successful]

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 1:8 (#4) (id: 775840)

**"you will make your ways prosperous"**

Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s **ways** as if they were a living thing that Joshua could **make … prosperous**. Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s actions as if they were **ways** or roads that he was walking on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Joshua 1:9 (#1) (id: 775841)

**"Have I not commanded you"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: \[Surely I have commanded you!]

## Joshua - Chapter 2 Introduction (id: 775866)

Joshua 2 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins the story of the conquest of the land of Canaan by describing how Joshua sends spies to investigate the situation in the city of Jericho.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Rahab’s faith

Even though Rahab was a Canaanite, she expressed her faith in Yahweh, the God of Israel. The statement “for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above and on the earth below” is an expression of her faith. Because Rahab recognized Yahweh as the true God, she helped the Israelites, and as a result, they spared her and her family. (See: Faith)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 2:1
* **Associated Articles:** Faith (ID: `26583@UWTranslationWords`)

## Joshua 2:1 (#1) (id: 775867)

**"Shittim"**

This is the name of a place on the east side of the Jordan River. It means “acacia trees.”

## Joshua 2:1 (#2) (id: 775868)

**"a woman, a prostitute, and her name {was} Rahab"**

The author is using the phrase **a woman, a prostitute** to introduce **Rahab** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: \[a certain woman named Rahab, who was a prostitute]

See: Introduction of New and Old Participants

* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of New and Old Participants (ID: `33421@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 2:2 (#1) (id: 775869)

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 2:2 (#2) (id: 775870)

**"Behold"**

The person addressing **the king** is speaking as if he wants him to look at something, but he is actually using the term **Behold** to focus attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: \[Listen]

**"Bring out the men, the ones coming to you, who came to your house, because they have come to search out all of the land"**

**"Then she lowered them down by a rope through the window"**

The author is describing a particular event before describing other events that preceded it. This actually occurred after Rahab spoke her final words to the spies in [2:21](https://ref.ly/Josh2:21). In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened and put the information in this verse after the quotation from Rahab in [2:21](https://ref.ly/Josh2:21).

The author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens in the story. Because Rahab’s house was built into the city wall, she was able to let the spies out a window and lower them down to the ground outside the city wall. That way they were able to escape from the city even though the gates had been shut. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

## Joshua - Chapter 3 Introduction (id: 775921)

Joshua 3 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins to describe how the Israelites crossed the Jordan River, even though it was at flood stage and overflowing its banks, because Yahweh stopped its waters from flowing.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### God dried up the Jordan River

Joshua told the people in 3:5, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst.” He meant that Yahweh would stop the Jordan River from flowing so that they could cross it. The people needed to be in a state of special dedication to Yahweh in order to appreciate what he was doing and take part in it. The conquest of the Promised Land was to be accomplished through the supernatural power of God. (See: Miracle and Promised Land)

## Joshua 3:2 (#1) (id: 775922)

**"at the end of three days"**

See how you translated the similar expression in [1:11](https://ref.ly/Josh1:11). Express this in the way your culture records time. Alternate translation: \[two days later] or \[after they had spent another full day in camp]

## Joshua 3:3–4 (#1) (id: 775923)

**"As you see the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh your God and the priests, the Levites, lifting it, then you yourselves shall set out from your place and go after it— but a distance shall be between you and between it, about 2, 000 cubits in measurement; do not come near to it—so that you will know the way in which you should go, since you have not passed over by the way from yesterday {or} the third day"**

If if it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of the phrases in these two verses so that the reason why Joshua wants the Israelites to follow the ark will precede the instructions he gives them to do that. Alternate translation: \[Since you have not passed over by the way from yesterday or the third day, so that you will know the way in which you should go, as you see the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh your God and the priests, the Levites, lifting it, then you yourselves shall set out from your place and go after it]

## Joshua 3:4 (#1) (id: 775924)

**"about 2, 000 cubits"**

The word **cubit** is a measurement equaling the distance from the elbow to the end of the middle finger tip. If it would help your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or a footnote. Alternate translation: \[about 900 meters] or \[about 1,000 yards]

**"from yesterday {or} the third day"**

As in [1:11](https://ref.ly/Josh1:11) and [3:2](https://ref.ly/Josh3:2), this expression means “yesterday or the day before.” But in contexts such as this, the expression means more generally “at any time in the past.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Joshua 3:10 (#1) (id: 775930)

**"and dispossessing, he will dispossess"**

Joshua is repeating forms of the verb **dispossess** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: \[and he will surely dispossess]

Joshua 4 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter finishes the story of how the Israelites crossed the Jordan River, even though it was at flood stage and overflowing its banks, because Yahweh stopped its waters from flowing.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Victory through the power of Yahweh

The conquest of the land of Canaan was accomplished by Yahweh’s power, which he would show to be greater than that of all the kings in the land of Canaan. Joshua recognized that the Israelites would only be victorious through Yahweh’s power. This is why his first act after crossing the Jordan River was to have them build a monument of stones from the river as a witness to Yahweh’s power.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Chiasm

Hebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary device called a “chiasm.” A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB\-BA sequence. This helped make a saying more memorable. Joshua uses a chiasm in 4:7 when he tells the Israelites what to say to their children when the ask about the monument of stones:

A Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off B from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh. B In its crossing over in the Jordan, A the waters of the Jordan were cut off.

You may be able to present this in your translation in a way that shows this literary device.

**"on the tenth {day} of the first month"**

The **first month** of the Hebrew calendar is named Aviv. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar. You say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote, for example, “The ‘first month’ was the month of Aviv, which is in the spring of the year, in March and April on Western calendars.” Alternate translation: \[on the tenth day of the month of Aviv]

## Joshua - Chapter 5 Introduction (id: 775976)

Joshua 5 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins with a notice of how the kings in the land of Canaan feared Yahweh when they heard how he had dried up the Jordan River so the Israelites could cross (5:1\).

The chapter then describes how the Israelites were careful to observe the law of Moses as soon as they entered the land of Canaan.

* The Israelite men were circumcised (5:2–9
* All the Israelites celebrated Passover (5:10–12\)

The chapter then describes how the commander of Yahweh’s army came to help Joshua defeat his enemies (5:13–15\)

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Circumcision

This was a sign of the covenant that Yahweh had given to the Israelites through Moses. The book of Joshua explains why the Israelite men who crossed the Jordan River had not yet been circumcised. Fulfilling this sign of the covenant was an important expression of how the Israelites would obey the whole law of Moses when they settled in the land of Canaan. It also affirmed the identity of Israel as a nation. Yahweh said that by having the Israelite men circumcised, he had removed “the disgrace of Egypt.” In Numbers 22:5, King Balak referred to the Israelites simply as “a people went out from Egypt,” in other words, a horde of runaway Egyptian slaves. Now the Israelites were being clearly constituted as a distinct people group with their own laws and customs as commanded by Yahweh. (See: Circumcise)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “a man … standing in front of him”

The author uses the expression “a man” to describe the figure who appears to Joshua in in 5:13, but in the next verse this figure explains that he is “the prince of the army of Yahweh.” So this is actually not a human being but more likely an angel. The author uses the phrase “a man” because that was what Joshua thought he was at first. Since this figure identifies himself in the next verse, you do not need to say anything such as “an angel who looked like a man” in 5:13 in your translation.

## Joshua 5:1 (#1) (id: 775977)

**"And it happened that"**

The author is using this phrase to introduce what happened at the end of the story of the Israelites crossing the Jordan River. Your language may have its own way of presenting such information.

## Joshua 5:1 (#2) (id: 775978)

**"the Amorite"** \- **"the Canaanite"**

The author is not referring to a specific **Amorite** or **Canaanite**. He means those people groups in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: \[the Amorites … the Canaanites]

**"and again, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time"**

This does not mean that these men had already been circumcised once and that Yahweh wanted Joshua to circumcise each of them for a **second time**. Rather, as [5:4](https://ref.ly/Josh5:4) explains, the previous generation of male Israelites had been circumcised, but they had died in the wilderness; the current generation of Israelite males had not yet been circumcised. Alternate translation: \[and do a second general circumcision of all Israelite males, for this generation]

## Joshua 5:3 (#1) (id: 775985)

**"And he circumcised"**

There were over 600,000 males, so the author is using **Joshua**, who was in charge of this task, to represent the many people who were necessarily involved.

**Gibeath Haaraloth** is the name that the Israelites gave to the place where they held this second general circumcision ceremony. The name commemorates the Israelites rededicating themselves to Yahweh.

## Joshua 5:4 (#1) (id: 775987)

**"having come out"** \- **"in their coming out"**

In a context such as this, your language may say “having gone” and “in their going out” rather than **having come** and **in their coming out**. Use whichever is more natural, here and in the next two verses.

**"they did not circumcise"**

Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context.

**"For the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all of the nation of the men of war having come out from Egypt, because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: \[Because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all of the nation of the men of war having come out from Egypt]

**"the nation of the men of war"**

The author seems to be speaking as if these **men of war** were a **nation** of their own. In this language and culture, people sometimes used the term “nation” to mean “army,” as in [Joel 1:6](https://ref.ly/Joel1:6), for example. Alternate translation: \[the men of war in the army]

## Joshua 5:6 (#6) (id: 775997)

**"to us"**

The author is addressing his listeners directly by saying **us**. Since the original listeners were Israelites, **us** would have been inclusive if he had marked that form. However, unless your readers are Israelites, they would not be included in the promises described here, which Yahweh made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. So it might be more natural in your language to use the exclusive form if your language marks that distinction. Decide as a team how to translate this.

**"a land flowing {with} milk and honey"**

Yahweh spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the **milk** and **honey** from those animals and plants were actually **flowing** through the land. If this metaphor makes sense in your language, you may translate it. If your language has metaphors that mean a land is good for producing healthy livestock and good crops, you may consider using those. If neither is the case, you could state the meaning plainly.

**"Joshua circumcised them. For they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them on the way"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could rearrange these three phrases so that each phrase gives the reason for the result that the next phrase describes. Alternate translation: \[Because they had not circumcised them on the way, they were uncircumcised. So Joshua circumcised them]

**"And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and bowed down"**

The phrase **fell on his face to the earth** means that Joshua intentionally got down on his knees and touched the ground with his face. In that culture, this action was a way that a person showed great respect and reverence for someone else. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also explain the significance of the gesture; the UST models one way to do that.

## Joshua - Chapter 6 Introduction (id: 776017)

Joshua 6 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes the supernatural way in which Yahweh enabled the Israelites to defeat the people of Jericho and destroy that city.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Yahweh conquers

The circumstances of Israel’s victory in the battle for Jericho were very unusual. An army would not normally march around a city or shout in order to win a military battle. It was Yahweh who gave the Israelites the victory, as Joshua made clear in 6:16\. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “devoted”

The specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.

## Joshua 6:1 (#1) (id: 776018)

**"Now Jericho {was} shutting and {was} being shut up from the face of the sons of Israel. There was no going out and there was no coming in"**

The author is providing background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

The phrases **Now Jericho was shutting and was being shut up** and **There was no going out and there was no coming in** mean basically the same thing. The author is using them together for emphasis. See the further discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: \[The rulers of Jericho were so afraid of the Israelites that they had shut the city gates so that no one could enter, and they had shut up the people inside so that no one could leave]

**"I have given"**

Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen.

## Joshua 6:2 (#4) (id: 776025)

**"the warriors of valor"**

Yahweh is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: \[and the warriors of valor] or \[along with the warriors of valor]

## Joshua 6:5 (#4) (id: 776031)

**"a man in front of him"**

Yahweh is using a common expression to mean that each of the soldiers in the army that is encircling the city should rush into the part of it that is directly in front of him.

**"Pass over"** \- **"will pass over"**

The phrase **Pass over** is a common expression that indicates walking or moving forward. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[Start walking … will walk]

## Joshua 6:8 (#2) (id: 776035)

**"to the face of Yahweh"**

As the last sentence in this verse makes clear, the author is using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean **the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh**, since it represents Yahweh’s presence with the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[in front of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh]

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:8
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 6:8 (#3) (id: 776036)

**"And the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh was going behind them"**

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:9

## Joshua 6:10 (#2) (id: 776040)

**"You shall not shout, and you shall not make your voice heard, and a word shall not go out from your mouth"**

The phrases **You shall not shout**, **you shall not make your voice heard**, and **a word shall not go out from your mouth** mean very similar things. Joshua says the same thing three times, in slightly different ways, to emphasize to the Israelite soldiers and priests that they must remain completely silent until he gives them the command, **Shout!** If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: \[You must remain completely silent] or \[You must remain absolutely quiet]

## Joshua 6:13 (#1) (id: 776043)

**"walking, {were} walking"**

The author is repeating the verb **walking** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses.

The author may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

**"Yahweh has given the city to you"**

Joshua is using the past tense in order to refer to something that Yahweh will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. See how you translated the similar expression in [6:2](https://ref.ly/Josh6:2).

**"Only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who {are} with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

**"you, keep yourselves"** \- **"you are devoting and you take"** \- **"and you make"**

**"Enter the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring out from there the woman and all who {are} to her, just as you swore to her"**

Joshua is describing one event before describing another event that preceded it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: \[Since you swore to the woman, the prostitute, that you would do this, enter her house and bring out from there the woman and all who are to her]

## Joshua 6:22 (#2) (id: 776061)

**"the woman, the prostitute"**

Joshua is using the phrase **the woman, the prostitute** to reintroduce Rahab as a participant in the story. If your language has its own way of reintroducing participants, you can use it here in your translation.

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: \[Because Rahab hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy on Jericho, Joshua kept her and the house of her father and all who belonged to her alive.

By **With** and **with**, Joshua does not mean that the man he is describing will work together with **his oldest son** to lay the foundations of Jericho and work together with **his youngest son** to set up its gates. He means that these sons will die at the beginning and ending of the rebuilding. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

## Joshua - Chapter 7 Introduction (id: 776073)

Joshua 7 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how the army of the city of Ai, which was much smaller than Jericho, was able to defeat the Israelites because one of them disobeyed Yahweh’s command not to take any plunder from Jericho. The chapter describes how Yahweh identified that person, a man named Achan, and how the Israelites punished him by execution for what he did.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Sin brought defeat

It was a great sin for Achan to take what Yahweh had said was to be destroyed. Because of his sin, Yahweh withheld victory from the Israelites. (See: Sin)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “devoted”

The specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.

### “went up”

As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, Hebrew writers marked travel descriptions for change in elevation. So the author typically says “went up” when he describes how the Israelite soldiers went from Gilgal in the Jordan River valley to the city of Ai in a hilly area. If your language does not mark travel notices for change in elevation, you can translate these expressions more simply and say “went.”

## Joshua 7:1 (#1) (id: 776074)

**"But the sons of Israel treacherously committed a treacherous act regarding a devoted thing"**

In this verse, the author is providing background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

See: Background Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Background Information (ID: `33415@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 7:1 (#2) (id: 776075)

**"But the sons of Israel treacherously committed a treacherous act"**

For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. The idea is that one Israelite did something secret and deceptive that was a betrayal of the trust that Yahweh had placed in all of the Israelites. Alternate translation: \[But the sons of Israel deceptively betrayed Yahweh]

## Joshua 7:1 (#5) (id: 776078)

**"the nose of Yahweh"**

The author is using the **nose** of Yahweh to mean his anger, by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: \[the anger of Yahweh]

**"Go up"** \- **"And the men went up"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the expressions **Go up** and **went up** indicate that the Israelite spies had to move upward in elevation in order to spy out Ai. If your language does not mark travel expressions for elevation, you could shorten these expressions here and throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: \[‘Go … And the men went]

In this verse, the author quotes Yahweh directly. Yahweh tells Joshua something he should say to the Israelites. And that includes telling them that Yahweh has said something. So there are three levels of quotation here. Use the appropriate punctuation in your language to mark these levels of quotation. Alternatively, you could translate this so that there are not quotations within quotations (see next note).

This is the beginning of a quotation within a quotation that continues through [7:15](https://ref.ly/Josh7:15). If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate all of it so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. The UST models one way to do that. Alternate translation: \[Consecrate the people and tell them to consecrate themselves for tomorrow]

Rather, the idea is that this was public evidence that the Israelites had found the wrongdoer and would punish him as Yahweh had told them to. Alternate translation: \[where Yahweh could see them] (2\) “in front of the tent of meeting.” The phrase could be a description of where the Israelites **poured … out** the silver coins, coat, and gold wedge. The author would be using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean the place where his presence was.

## Joshua - Chapter 8 Introduction (id: 776150)

Joshua 8 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

Joshua 8:1–29 describes how the Israelites were able to defeat the army of the city of Ai and destroy that city once they had dealt with Achan’s sin of taking plunder from Jericho. Yahweh told the Israelites how to defeat the city by putting some of their soldiers in an ambush.

Joshua 8:30–35 then describes how the Israelites affirmed their covenant with Yahweh at Mount Ebal, just as Moses had told them to do.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### The altar on Mount Ebal

By building an altar on Mount Ebal and writing out a copy of the law on the stones, Joshua was fulfilling what Moses had commanded the Israelites in Deuteronomy 11:26–32 and 27:1–26\. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in a footnote.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Did Joshua put 30,000 or 5,000 soldiers in the ambush?

Verses 3–9 seem to describe Joshua sending 30,000 soldiers to lie in ambush to the west of the city of Ai. But verse 12, which seems to be a summary of that same action, says that Joshua sent 5,000 soldiers. Interpreters explain this in different ways. Some say that verse 12 is not actually a summary and Joshua sent out two groups for two different purposes, for example, one to rush into the city and another to guard the flank of the main army or to cut off escaping soldiers. Other interpreters suggest that the original 30,000 soldiers may have realized that there were more of them than were needed for the ambush and that they could not all hide without being seen, so they returned to Joshua, and he sent back only 5,000 of them. Still other interpreters suggest that the number 30,000 could be a copyist’s error and that verse 3 should actually read “5,000\.” Whatever the explanation, it is a matter of interpretation rather than translation. The Hebrew text reads “30,000” in verse 3 and “5,000” in verse 12, and we encourage you to translate the text that way.

### Descriptions of relative location

In several places in this chapter, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. He tells from what direction a person would approach a certain place from the location they were in. In your translation express this in the way your culture describes the relative location of places. For example, in 8:8, you might say “to the west of Ai” rather than “from the west of Ai.”

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 8:1

## Joshua 8:1 (#1) (id: 776151)

**"Do not fear and do not be dismayed"**

The phrases **Do not fear** and **do not be dismayed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using them together to emphasize that Joshua and the Israelite soldiers must not be afraid. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[Do not be afraid at all] or \[There is absolutely no reason for you to be fearful]

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the expression **go up** indicates that the Israelite army had to move upward in elevation in order to attack **Ai**. If your language does not mark travel expressions for elevation, you could shorten such expressions, here and throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: \[go]

The author is speaking of the Israelite army as if it were a foot and the soldiers who hid **west** of Ai as its **heel**. He means that those soldiers were at the edge of the force.

The author has just said that Joshua went and spent the night in the valley near Ai, and the king may have seen him in the morning and concluded that this was the main force of the Israelite army and that he could attack and destroy it. Alternate translation: \[as soon as the king of Ai saw Joshua] (2\) that the king saw that the Israelite army was north of the city.

**"Stretch out with the curved sword that is in your hand toward Ai, because I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out with the curved sword that was in his hand toward the city"**

This action was a literal sign to Joshua’s soldiers to attack Ai, as the next verse indicates, but it was probably also a symbolic indication that Ai was to be destroyed. You should retain this action in your translation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate its meaning in footnote.

## Joshua 8:19 (#1) (id: 776187)

**"And the ambush rose quickly from its place, and they ran"**

The word **ambush** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people acting together. That is why the pronoun **they** is plural.

**"And these came out from the city to meet them, so they were in the midst of Israel"**

The pronoun **these** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire. The pronoun **them** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had openly attacked Ai and then pretended to flee, but then turned around to attack their enemies. The pronoun **they** refers to the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: \[And the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire came out from the city to meet the Israelite soldiers who had just turned around to attack, so the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel were in the midst of Israel]

**"And they struck them until he left to him no survivor or fugitive"**

After referring to the Israelite soldiers as **they** and the soldiers from Ai and Bethel as **them**, the author then refers to the Israelites as **he** and to their enemies as **him**. This probably reflects the use earlier in the verse of the singular term **Israel** to represent the Israelite soldiers. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns throughout this sentence. Alternate translation: \[And they struck them until they left to them no survivor or fugitive]

## Joshua - Chapter 9 Introduction (id: 776214)

Joshua 9 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how the people of the city of Gibeon deceived the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### How the Israelites were deceived

The Israelites were deceived because “they did not ask the mouth of Yahweh” (9:14\), that is, they did not ask Yahweh for guidance. Instead of consulting Yahweh, they reached conclusions of their own based on what they considered to be reasonable in light of the evidence they had. The Bible says instead, in [Proverbs 3:5](https://ref.ly/Prov3:5) “Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.” (See: Inquire)

### The Hivites

In [3:10](https://ref.ly/Josh3:10), the Israelites are given a list of the nations that they are told to dispossess from the land. This list includes the Hivites. In [9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:2), the author of Joshua records that when the kings on the west side of the Jordan River heard what the Israelites had done to Ai, they made an agreement to fight against the Israelites. The list in [9:2](https://ref.ly/Josh9:2) of kings who agreed to fight against the Israelites includes “the Hivite.” The author records in [9:3–4](https://ref.ly/Josh9:3-Josh9:4) that when “those who dwelled in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to the Ai … they … acted with cunning.” The author then records in [9:7](https://ref.ly/Josh9:7) that those who dwelled in Gibeon were “Hivite.” The Hivite nation consisted of multiple people groups, of whom the Gibeonites were just one. This is why the author could say in [9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:2) that among the kings who gathered to fight the Israelites were Hivites and also say that the Gibeonites were Hivites.

### “Cut a covenant”

The phrase “cut a covenant” occurs several times in this chapter. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.

**"And they acted, they also, with cunning"**

The word **also** does not indicate that the other kings had acted **with cunning** and the people of Gibeon did the same. Rather, the idea is that the other kings acted by joining forces to fight the Israelites, and the people of Gibeon **also** acted, but **with cunning** rather than by fighting. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: \[And they also took action, but unlike the other kings, they did not prepare to fight; they used cunning]

For emphasis, the **leaders** are stating a pronoun, the meaning of which is already present in the verb translated as **sworn**.

## Joshua - Chapter 10 Introduction (id: 776268)

Joshua 10 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how other Canaanite kings attacked the city of Gibeon because it was a great city and they were concerned because its people had allied themselves with the Israelites. The chapter also describes how Joshua and the Israelite army went and defended the city and defeated its attackers (10:1–27\).

The chapter then describes how Joshua and the Israelite army went and defeated and destroyed each of the cities whose kings had attacked Gibeon, the cities of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir (10:28–43\).

The ULT sets the lines in 10:12–13 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a poem.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Complete destruction of cities

The war that the Israelites fought against the Canaanites was different from other wars. Yahweh gave Israel special instructions about how they were to deal with the people they defeated, including completely destroying them and their cities. These were unique circumstances, and armies today are not supposed to act in the same way.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “devoted”

The specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.

### “to the mouth of the sword”

This expression occurs several times in this chapter, often in connection with the term “devoted.” See the discussion of this expression in the General Introduction to Joshua, and see how the UST represents its meaning.

### “come up,” “went up”

As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, Hebrew writers marked travel descriptions for change in elevation. The author follows this usage in several places in this chapter. If your language does not mark travel notices for change in elevation, you can translate these expressions more simply For example, in 10:6 you might have the Gibeonites say simply “come to us” rather than “come up to us.”

## Joshua 10:2 (#1) (id: 776270)

**"that they feared greatly"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. This first phrase would then be at the end of the verse. Alternate translation: \[then they feared greatly]

## Joshua 10:11 (#1) (id: 776288)

**"in their fleeing from the face of Israel"**

The author is using the expression **from the face of** by association to mean “in front of.” Since the fleeing enemies were in front of the Israelites, the Israelites were behind them, and it may be more natural in your language to express the meaning that way.

**"Sun, be still over Gibeon, and moon, over the Valley of Aijalon"**

Since the author says that here **Joshua spoke to Yahweh**, and since Joshua by himself did not have the power to stop the sun and moon from moving through the sky, this is implicitly a prayer or request from Joshua to Yahweh. You may wish to translate it that way.

## Joshua - Chapter 11 Introduction (id: 776336)

Joshua 11 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how the Israelites fought a great battle near the city of Merom and defeated a coalition of the armies of the kings who ruled cities in the northern part of the land of Canaan.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Why did Joshua not burn the cities that had been built on mounds?

Joshua 11:13 says that while Joshua and the Israelite army burned down most of the cities they conquered, they did not burn any of the cities that had been built on mounds or hills except for Hazor. This was probably because the elevated location of those cities offered them a strategic advantage. They probably already had defensive walls. So Yahweh allowed them to live in those cities, where they would be safer and more secure from attack. It is not necessary to put anything about this in the text of your translation, but you could explain it in a footnote.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “devoted,” “to the mouth of the sword”

=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter provides a summary of the kings whom Joshua and the Israelites conquered.

The ULT sets the lines in 12:2–5 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are part of a long list.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 12:1

## Joshua 12:1 (#1) (id: 776375)

**"Now these {are} the kings of the land"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here the author begins to provide background information about how the Israelites divided up the land they conquered. This background information continues through Chapter 21\. In this chapter, the author provides a summary of all the territories the Israelites conquered.

## Joshua 12:1 (#2) (id: 776376)

**"on the other side of the Jordan, from the rising of the sun"**

As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout the following chapters, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. He means here that if someone were traveling from the territories he is about to describe to the area where most of the Israelites settled, he would be coming **from the rising of the sun**, that is, from the east. In your translation, express this in the way your culture describes the relative location of places. Alternate translation: \[to the east of the Jordan River]

## Joshua - Chapter 13 Introduction (id: 776393)

Joshua 13 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, the author begins to describe how Joshua divided among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. (This description continues through Chapter 21\.) This chapter summarizes the land that remained for the Israelites to conquer (13:1–7\) and reviews how Moses distributed the land the Israelites conquered east of the Jordan River to some of the tribes (13:8–32\).

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

## Joshua - Chapter 14 Introduction (id: 776436)

Joshua 14 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It begins to describe the division of the land west of the Jordan River (14:1–5\), and it relates how Joshua gave the city of Hebron and the surrounding area to Caleb (14:6–15\).

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

## Joshua 14:1 (#1) (id: 776437)

**"inherited"**

## Joshua 14:1 (#2) (id: 776438)

**"and the heads of the fathers of"**

The author is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He is using the word **fathers** to mean “father’s houses.” In ancient Israel, that expression described extended families, comprising three or four generations, led by a man who was the father, grandfather, or great\-grandfather of the family members. The household also included servants. You can supply this word in your translation or use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: \[and the heads of the father’s houses of] or \[and the men who led the extended families of]

**"If the land on which your foot has trodden will not be for an inheritance for you and for your sons unto forever"**

Following the custom of his culture, Moses is swearing an oath by stating the first part of a condition (**if**) but not the second part (“then”). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explicitly state the second part of this condition.

Joshua 15 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It describes how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the tribe of Judah (15:1–63\).

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

## Joshua 15:4 (#2) (id: 776478)

**"This will be for you the border of the south"**

The author is not addressing all of his readers directly and telling them that this will be their border. Rather, he is quoting the words that Yahweh told Moses to speak to the Israelites in [Numbers 34:3](https://ref.ly/Num34:3) about what their southern border would be as a nation. The implication is that the territory of the tribe of Judah would extend to the south all the way to this national border.

## Joshua 15:18 (#3) (id: 776501)

**"that she persuaded him to request the field from her father"**

The author is leaving implicit who was to make this request. The meaning does not seem to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that he should **request** this **field** from Caleb, since he is not the one who asks; she is. In this culture, a young man such as Othniel may not have had the standing to make this kind of request from a leader such as Caleb. So the meaning seems to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that she should ask for the field. In this culture, a daughter may have been able to make such a request of her father. Alternate translation: \[that she persuaded him to allow her to request the field]

**"the field from her father"**

The author has a particular **field** in view. The narrative suggests implicitly that Caleb had given some land to Othniel but that it was arid territory. It suggests further that near this land, there was some ground that was suitable for cultivation because it was watered by springs. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

## Joshua 15:19 (#2) (id: 776505)

**"a blessing"**

In this context, the word **blessing** is an abstract noun. It does not refer to something that someone would say to cause good and beneficial things to happen to a person. Instead, it refers to a good and beneficial thing itself. If your language does not use abstract nouns in this way, you could express the same idea in another way.

**"you shall also give to me"**

Aksah is using a verb form that could either indicate what a person ought to do or what a person is going to do. This could mean: (1\) that since the land Caleb gave Aksah and Othniel was dry, he also ought to give them some land with springs of water. Alternate translation: \[you should also give me] (2\) that Aksah is answering Caleb’s question and this is implicitly her request. Alternate translation: \[my request is that you will also give me]

## Joshua - Chapter 16 Introduction (id: 776527)

Joshua 16 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It begins to describe how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the two tribes that were descendants of Joseph (16:1–4\), starting with the tribe of Ephraim (16:5–10\).

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

## Joshua - Chapter 17 Introduction (id: 776542)

Joshua 17 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It continues the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the two tribes that were descendants of Joseph. It describes the land he gave to the tribe of Manasseh (17:1–18\).

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

The author is reminding readers of what he has already told them in [16:4](https://ref.ly/Josh16:4), that the descendants of Joseph had become the two tribes of Ephraim and **Manasseh**. So most of the tribal allotments went to descendants of Jacob’s sons, but the allotments described in [16:5–10](https://ref.ly/Josh16:5-Josh16:10) and in this chapter went to descendants of Jacob’s grandsons.

The author is speaking of these towns as if they were the **daughters** of the main cities. See how you translated this expression in [15:45](https://ref.ly/Josh15:45) where it is used with the same meaning.

Alternate translation: \[these last three cities being in the heights of Dor] (2\) that the author wants readers to recognize that the city he calls **Dor** was also known as Naphoth Dor.

## Joshua 17:13 (#1) (id: 776568)

**"But dispossessing, they did not dispossess him"**

The author is repeating forms of the verb **dispossess** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses.

## Joshua 17:16 (#2) (id: 776577)

**"and a chariot of iron {is} with every Canaanite"**

Iron, the metal, was barely used during this time period, so this is not a reference to chariots entirely made of **iron**. Those would have been too heavy for any practical use in warfare anyway. It is probably a reference by association to chariots whose wheels or floor were strengthened with iron or that had iron studs or points to make them more destructive when used in ramming. Alternate translation: \[and chariots fitted out with iron are with every Canaanite]

## Joshua - Chapter 18 Introduction (id: 776585)

Joshua 18 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It begins the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the remaining tribes of Israel:

* Joshua sent men to survey and divide the remaining land (18:1–10\)
* Joshua assigned land to the tribe of Benjamin (18:11–28\)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

## Joshua - Chapter 19 Introduction (id: 776620)

Joshua 19 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It concludes the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the remaining tribes of Israel:

* Simeon (19:1–9\)
* Zebulun (19:10–16\)
* Issachar (19:17–23\)
* Asher (19:24–31\)
* Naphtali (19:32–39\)
* Dan (19:40–48\) The chapter also describes how the Israelites gave territory to Joshua (19:49–51\)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Ordinal numbers

In this chapter, the author uses ordinal numbers to describe the lots for each of the remaining tribes in the order in which those tribes were selected. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers or an equivalent expression.

### Translation issues specific to this section

See Part 4 of the General Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:

1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.
2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”
3. The author describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named.
4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.
5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.
6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.
7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

This chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up the land the Israelites conquered. It describes how Joshua designated certain cities to be cities of refuge (20:1–9\).

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Cities of refuge

If a person was murdered, in this culture it was the duty of his relatives to provide justice by killing the murderer. However, if someone was killed by accident, it would be unfair to kill the person who had killed him accidentally. Therefore, God told the Israelites to designate “cities of refuge” to which a person who killed someone accidentally could flee. In those cities, these cases would be resolved legally. (See: Refuge and Avenge and blood)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Quotes in quotes

In verses 2–6, there is a long quotation within a quotation. Yahweh tells Joshua something that he is to tell the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Notes suggest how to do that in the cases of verses 2 and 3\. The rest of the second\-level quotation can be made a first\-level quotation without any changes in the wording.

### Relative locations

In listing the cities of refuge, the author often describes the location of one place relative another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says from what direction someone would be approaching a new location from a location he has already named. Translate these descriptions the way you have done in the previous part of this section of the book of Joshua.

**"and he shall speak his words in the ears of the elders of that city"**

Yahweh is using the term **words** to mean what this person would say by using words, and he is using the term **ears** by association to mean hearing and understanding.

Joshua 21 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter concludes the description of how Joshua divided up the land the Israelites conquered. It describes how Joshua designated certain cities for the Levites to live in, since they had no tribal territory of their own (21:1–45\).

### Ellipsis

In many places in this chapter, the author leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Notes suggest approaches to this issue in several specific instances. (See: Ellipsis)

**"And the lot came out for the clans of the Kohathite. And for the sons of Aaron the priest, from the Levites, there were 13 cities by the lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonite and from the tribe of Benjamin"**

The author assumes that readers will understand that the leaders decided to assign cities to the groups of Levites in a particular order (Kohathite priests, Kohathite non\-priests, Gershonites, and Merarites) and then cast lots to see which cities would go to each group. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[The leaders started by casting lots to decide which cities would belong to the Levites from the Kohathite clan who were priests, descendants of Aaron.

## Joshua - Chapter 22 Introduction (id: 776679)

Joshua 22 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how Joshua dismissed the armies of the tribes that had settled on the east side of the Jordan River. It also describes how they built an altar to remind their descendants to worship Yahweh and how they resolved a misunderstanding about this altar with the other Israelites (22:1–34\).

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Quotations within quotations

In verses 16–20 and 22–29, there are long quotations that include quotations within quotations and, in verses 24–25, 27, and 28, quotations within quotations within quotations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate these so that there are not a quotations within quotations. Notes suggest ways to do this.

### “the sons of Israel”

While this phrase typically refers to all of the Israelites, in this chapter it means specifically the people of the tribes that settled on the west side of the Jordan River. Be sure that this meaning is clear in your translation.

### “brothers”

In this chapter, Joshua and the author use the term “brothers” to mean people who are descended from the same ancestor. In your translation, you may wish to communicate this meaning by using an expression such as “fellow Israelites.” (See: Metaphor)

### “tents”

Joshua uses the name of one kind of dwelling, “tents,” to mean all kinds of dwellings. In your translation, you may wish to communicate this meaning by using a word such as “homes.” (See: Synecdoche)

### “tomorrow”

In this chapter, characters use the word “tomorrow” several times to mean “in the future.” You may wish to use that phrase in your translation to communicate the meaning.

## Joshua 22:1 (#1) (id: 776680)

**"to the Reubenite and to the Gadite"**

The author is not referring to specific individuals. He means the members of these tribes in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: \[to the Reubenites and to the Gadites]

## Joshua 22:2 (#1) (id: 776681)

**"And you have listened to my voice according to all that I have commanded you"**

Joshua is using the term **voice** by association to mean the commands he gave by using his voice. He is using the word **listened** by association to mean complying with what he said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use equivalent expressions or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[And you have obeyed all my commands that I have commanded you]

## Joshua 22:3 (#4) (id: 776685)

**"but you have kept the keeping of the commandments of Yahweh your God"**

For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: \[but you have carefully kept the commandments of Yahweh your God]

The terms **commandment** and **instruction** mean similar things. Joshua is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[to do everything that Moses, the servant of Yahweh commanded you]

Joshua 23 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how Joshua brought the Israelites together, probably to his home in Timnath Serah, to give them a final exhortation before he died. (23:1–16\).

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Joshua’s instructions

It was common in the Ancient Near East for an important leader to give his people instructions in anticipation of his death. If leaders in your culture also do this, translate this in a way that will help your readers recognize the practice that Joshua is following.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:1

## Joshua 23:1 (#1) (id: 776759)

**"from many days afterward"**

The author is using the term **days** by association to mean time, since time is made up of days. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: \[a long time after that]

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 23:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Joshua 23:1 (#2) (id: 776760)

**"that Joshua had aged, he had come into days"**

To translate this expression here and in the next verse, see how you translated the similar expression in [13:1](https://ref.ly/Josh13:1). Alternate translation: \[that Joshua had grown very old] or \[that Joshua had become a very old man]

**"But you yourselves have seen"** \- **"your God"** \- **"from your faces"** \- **"your God"** \- **"for you"**

The words **you**, **yourselves**, and **your** are plural throughout this chapter because Joshua is addressing the assembled Israelites and their leaders. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

**"from your faces"**

Joshua is using one part of the Israelites, their **faces**, to represent all of them.

## Joshua - Chapter 24 Introduction (id: 776793)

Joshua 24 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter describes how Joshua had the Israelites gather in the city of Shechem to renew their covenant with Yahweh (24:1–28\). It then describes how Joshua died and was buried and how the Israelites also buried the remains of other leaders who had died (24:29–33\).

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### “Cut a covenant”

The phrase “cut a covenant” occurs in this chapter, as it did several times in Chapter 9\. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “you,” “your”

Yahweh, speaking through Joshua, often addresses the current generation of Israelites with the pronouns “you” and “your,” as if he had done the things he describes directly for them. Yahweh is actually using those pronouns to refer to the ancestors of the Israelites, the people whom he brought out of Egypt, by association with the current generation. In your translation, you could express this meaning by using expressions such as “your ancestors.” (See: Metonymy)

### “fathers”

Often in this chapter, Yahweh speaks of the ancestors of the Israelites he is addressing as if they were their actual “fathers.” In your translation, you could express this meaning by using a term such as “ancestors.” (See: Metaphor)

### “the Amorite,” “the foreigner,” etc.

Often in this chapter, Yahweh and Joshua use expressions such as “the Amorite.” They are not referring to a specific Amorite. They mean the Amorite people in general. The meaning is also general in similar instances, including “the foreigner” in verses 20 and 23\. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of how you can do this through the end of this second\-level quotation in verse 13\.

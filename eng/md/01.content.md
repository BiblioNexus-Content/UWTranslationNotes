## Genesis - Introduction (id: 718624)

Introduction to Genesis
=======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

In the book of Genesis, God communicates to all people the early history of the universe. He begins with how he created everything from nothing, including the earth and all the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars), all the plants and animals, and especially how he created human beings in his image to be in a relationship with him. This book also explains how sin and death came into the world and what God’s plan is to save people from that. In fact, all the important teachings in the Bible begin in Genesis. That makes this book **foundational** and important for everyone so that they can know and understand the truth about God and his plan for their lives.

Beginning with verse 1, the book of Genesis is a **narrative** that tells the history of events that actually happened. This is confirmed by the fact that the conjunctions and the forms of the verbs that are used in the Hebrew text reflect the Hebrew narrative style, which is used to narrate historical accounts. In the same way, those who translate the book of Genesis should also use grammatical structures in their languages that are used for true, historical narratives. God uses narrative, which is one of the most interesting styles of communication, to not only tell people about the events in the early history of the world, but also to teach them about himself and about the way he interacts with people as their loving Creator.

Genesis provides the **vital context** for the rest of God’s Word, especially the gospel message about Jesus, and so it helps people to understand their need for him to be their Savior. In fact, without Genesis, it would not be clear why everyone needs to trust in Jesus as the only one who can save them from sin and its consequences, so that they can associate with God and be part of his eternal family.

In light of all that, Genesis should be one of the first books of the Bible that is translated into every language that needs a translation. May God guide and bless you and your translation team as you undertake this important task together by his power.

### Author and date of writing

Moses was the human author of the first five books of the Bible, including the book of Genesis (Exodus 24:3–4; Deuteronomy 31:9, 24; John 1:45\). The Holy Spirit is the one who inspired what Moses wrote in those books (2 Peter 1:21\), so ultimately God is the author, and these books are part of his Message to mankind. Those five books are sometimes referred to as the Torah (a Hebrew word that means “teaching,” “instruction,” or “law”) or the Pentateuch (a Greek word that means “five books”). In the New Testament this set of books is also referred to as “the Law” (John 1:45\) or “the Law of Moses” (Acts 28:23\), and Jesus himself affirmed that Moses wrote them (John 5:46–47; 7:23\).

Moses was born in the country of Egypt around 1526 B.C. (Exodus 2:1–10\). According to the genealogies in Genesis, his birth was about 1,000 years after the Flood (which was about 1,650 years after creation). Moses may have written much of the Pentateuch during the forty years that he led the people of Israel as they wandered in the wilderness (around 1446 B.C.—1406 B.C.).

The very first verse in Genesis assumes that God (the author guiding the human author) has always existed and that he has no beginning and no end (also see Genesis 21:33; Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2\). He uses his personal name “Yahweh” for the first time in Genesis 2:4\. The name “Yahweh” means “he is” and indicates that God is eternal. His name also means that he is unchanging and that he is always present.

### Book outline

In all, Genesis covers a span of about 2200 years of history. After the world’s early history, the rest of Genesis tells about the ancestors of God’s people, with special focus on Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (and their families). Genealogies are an important part of what ties the book together from beginning to end.

The following outline shows these two main divisions in the book of Genesis: (1\) Early World History, and (2\) The History about the Ancestors of God’s Chosen People. Those two divisions each have roughly four main subdivisions, which are based on four key events (in the first division) and four key ancestors (in the second division). Some scholars prefer to divide the book up into ten divisions that are introduced by the Hebrew phrase that means “these are the generations of...” In the outline below, **asterisks** mark the sections that contain that phrase. The phrase is found in Genesis 2:4 (heavens and earth), 5:1 (Adam), 6:9 (Noah), 10:1, 32 (sons of Noah), 11:10 (Shem), 11:27 (Terah), 25:12 (Ishmael), 25:19 (Isaac), 36:1, 9 (Esau), and 37:2 (Jacob).

### Special formatting

The book of Genesis sometimes uses poetic language to emphasize what is being said. Many translations use a special format to identify these passages as poetry by indenting each clause on a new line. Many other translations do not do this, but rather use regular paragraph formatting everywhere, including for poetry. It may be helpful to look at a translation in the national language of your country that uses poetry formatting, to help you decide whether or not you want to do something similar in your translation. Some translations put some of the following passages in poetry format since these verses have certain features of poetry such as parallelisms and metaphors: Genesis 1:27; 2:23; 3:14–16, 17b\-19; 4:23–24; 8:22; 9:6, 25–27; 12:2–3; 14:19–20; 15:1; 16:11–12; 24:60; 25:23; 27:27–29, 39–40; 48:15–16, 20; 49:1–27\. You may not want to put all these passages in poetry format since some of them have parallelisms that are not necessarily poetry but may just be emphasizing certain events in the narrative or certain points in a prophecy.

## Genesis - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 718625)

### Possible titles for this book:

* “Genesis”
* “The Book of Genesis”
* “Genesis: The First Book By Moses”
* “Genesis: The Book About Beginnings”
* “The First Book That God's Prophet/Spokesman Moses Wrote: Genesis”

The English title “Genesis” is a transliteration of a Greek word that means “origin” or “beginning” or “birth”; the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures (the Septuagint) uses this word for the first time in Genesis 2:4\. The Hebrew title of this book בְּרֵאשִׁית (pronounced “bereshith”) is the first Hebrew word in verse 1 and literally means “In the beginning.” The Latin translation of the Bible (the Latin Vulgate) was the first translation to use the title “The Book of Genesis.” Since that time, many other translations include “Genesis” in the book title because people are familiar with that name. Sometimes as part of the title, translators also include the fact that Moses was the author and that he was inspired by God. Do what is best in your language.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:1

## Genesis 1:1 (#1) (id: 262940)

**"In the beginning"**

The first chapter of Genesis is a true historical narrative (which is indicated by the Hebrew language structures that are used throughout the chapter), and verse 1 records the first event in that history. This is confirmed by the wider context of the Scriptures, which teach us that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3\). Some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than an abstract noun (**beginning**). Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “At the beginning of time”

## Genesis 1:1 (#2) (id: 262941)

**"God"**

Translate the title **God** in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed.

## Genesis 1:1 (#3) (id: 262942)

**"created"**

In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter 1 is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. Alternate translation: “made”

## Genesis 1:2 (#1) (id: 262945)

**"Now the earth"**

The author pauses here to describe what the earth and the heavens were like after God first created them (verse 1\). Some languages use a conjunction like **Now** to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated **the earth** in verse 1\. Alternate translation: “Now at first after that, the earth”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:2

## Genesis 1:2 (#2) (id: 262946)

**"was formless and empty"**

It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1\) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have its present form, and there was nothing living on it yet,” or (2\) “completely empty/desolate,” which treats the text as a hendiadys. However, it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as they are in the Hebrew text).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:2

## Genesis 1:2 (#3) (id: 262947)

**"and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters"**

For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “It was completely dark, there was deep water everywhere,” or “There was deep water everywhere that was surrounded by total darkness,”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:2

## Genesis 1:2 (#4) (id: 262948)

**"and the Spirit of God was hovering"**

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1\) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” or (2\) “and a wind from God was blowing” or (3\) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb **hovering** does not describe what wind does.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:2

## Genesis 1:2 (#5) (id: 262949)

**"over the surface of the waters"**

Throughout this chapter, the word **waters** is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context. Alternate translation: “over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:2

## Genesis 1:3 (#1) (id: 262950)

**"Then God said"**

What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. Alternate translation: “Then God commanded,”

See: Quotations and Quote Margins

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Quotations and Quote Margins (ID: 33426)

## Genesis 1:3 (#2) (id: 262951)

**"Let there be light"**

This is a command, not a permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation point with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate **light** should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself. Alternate translation: “Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:3

## Genesis 1:3 (#3) (id: 262952)

**"And there was light"**

Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command. Alternate translation: “So immediately there was light.” or “And so light started shining.”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:3

## Genesis 1:4 (#1) (id: 262953)

**"And God saw"**

Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as **And** or **Then** at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew uses conjunctions. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. Alternate translation: “And he saw” or “He saw”

## Genesis 1:4 (#2) (id: 262954)

**"the light, that {it was} good"**

In the Bible, **good** is an important theme. Throughout chapter 1, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20\). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. Alternate translation: “that the light was good”

## Genesis 1:4 (#3) (id: 262955)

**"Then God separated"**

In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as **God**) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, **God** is repeated frequently in chapter 1 to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say **God** only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter 1, do what is best in your language each time that you refer to God.

## Genesis 1:4 (#4) (id: 262956)

**"Then God separated between the light and the darkness"**

Alternate translation: “Then he separated the light from the darkness so that each had its own time.” or “Then he caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “Then he separated the light from the darkness so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours.”

## Genesis 1:5 (#1) (id: 262957)

**"And God called"**

Some languages omit the connecting word **And** or **Then** here. Consider what is the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. Alternate translation: “Then God called” or “God named”

* **Associated Articles:** Connecting Words and Phrases (ID: 33335)

## Genesis 1:5 (#2) (id: 262958)

**"the light Day"**

Notice that in this context the word **Day** refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24\-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter 1, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created. Do what is best in your language.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:5

## Genesis 1:5 (#3) (id: 262959)

**"and the darkness he called Night"**

In the Hebrew text, **the darkness** is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider what is the best way to translate this clause in your language. Alternate translation: “and the darkness he called Nighttime.” or “and he named the darkness Nighttime.”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 1:5

## Genesis 1:5 (#4) (id: 262960)

**"Then there was evening, and there was morning"**

The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24\-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one\-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” and would fit well here. Alternate translation: “Then evening came, and then morning came,”

## Genesis 1:5 (#5) (id: 262961)

**"one day"**

Here **day** refers to a full 24\-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (**one**) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second,” “third,” and so on) for the rest of the days of the creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one,” “day two,” and so on). Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and that was day one.”

## Genesis 1:6 (#2) (id: 262963)

**"Let there be an expanse"**

The Hebrew word for **expanse** here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, but rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20\). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated **Let there be** in verse 3\. Alternate translation: “Let there be a vast space” or “I command there to be a vast space” or “I command a vast space to form”

## Genesis 1:7 (#1) (id: 262966)

**"So God made"**

Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice. Alternate translation: “In that way God made” or “That is how he made”

## Genesis 1:7 (#4) (id: 262969)

**"between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse"**

For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (**it**) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places, and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the water that was below the expanse from the water that was above it.” or “the water that was under it from the water that was above it.”

**"Let us make"**

Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (**us** and **our**) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible. Alternate translation: “Now we will make”

## Genesis 1:27 (#3) (id: 263084)

**"in his image"**

God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation. You could include some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “in his own image.” or “to be similar to himself in many ways.”

## Genesis 2:4 (#1) (id: 263127)

**"These {are"**

This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5–24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “These are more details about” or “This is more about” or “What follows gives more details about”

## Genesis 2:4 (#2) (id: 263128)

**"the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created"**

The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: “the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created by God,” or “what happened when God created the heavens and the earth.”

**"in the day {when"**

Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5\. Alternate translation: “during the days when” or “During the days when”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:4

## Genesis 2:4 (#4) (id: 263130)

**"Yahweh God"**

This phrase is a combination of God’s personal name **Yahweh** with his title “God.” Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, “Ahab king of Israel” and “Ruth the Moabitess.” Many translations have “LORD God” in place of **Yahweh God** throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title “Adonai” (which means “my Lord”) for **Yahweh** (which means “he is”) when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting **Yahweh** back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh.” However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from **Yahweh** and combining them with the vowels from “Adonai.”) Alternate translation: “God whose name is Yahweh”

## Genesis 2:4 (#5) (id: 263131)

**"made the earth and the heavens"**

This clause forms a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth … created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated **the heavens** and **the earth** in Gen 1:1 and 2:1\. Alternate translation: “created the earth and the heavens”

## Genesis 2:5 (#1) (id: 263132)

**"and every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth"**

Consider whether or not it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here. Verses 5–6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7\). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Now for a while, there were not yet any shrubs in the fields on the earth,” or “For a while, no wild shrubs had started growing on the earth yet,”

## Genesis 2:5 (#3) (id: 263134)

**"because Yahweh God"**

The Hebrew text repeats **Yahweh God** frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4\) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat **Yahweh God** so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use **Yahweh God** only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use **Yahweh**, **God**, or “he” in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation. Alternate translation: “because he”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 2:7

## Genesis 2:7 (#2) (id: 263144)

**"the man"**

The definite article **the** is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human.

## Genesis 2:8 (#1) (id: 263150)

**"Now Yahweh God had planted"**

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1\) “Now Yahweh God had previously/already planted” or “Before that, Yahweh God had planted”. This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11–12\), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26–27; 2:7\). Following this view, verses 8–14 give background information for what happens in verses 15–24\. (2\) “Then Yahweh God planted”. According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man.

Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam’s name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word “adam” means **man** and is also Adam’s name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam’s name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many other translations start using his name at the end of verse 20\. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17, or 21\. Alternate translation: “to Adam”

**"among the tree{s} of the garden"**

Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, for some languages it may be more natural to be general here and say “there”. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in the midst of the trees in the garden.” or “behind some trees there.”

**"The woman whom you gave {to be} with me, she"**

The pronoun **she** is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of **The woman** at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame of the woman.

In this context, **cursed** involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants, causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. Alternate translation: “you are cursed by me” or “I will cause you to suffer” or “I will punish you”

## Genesis 3:14 (#3) (id: 263295)

**"above all the livestock"**

When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals. See how you translated **livestock** in Gen 1:24–26; 2:20\. Alternate translation: “more harshly than all the tame animals”

## Genesis 3:14 (#6) (id: 263298)

**"and you will eat dust"**

Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated **dust** in Gen 2:7\. Alternate translation: “and you will eat dirt with your food”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 3:15

## Genesis 3:15 (#2) (id: 263301)

**"He"**

The pronoun **He** is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1\) the woman’s descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ; or (2\) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power (Hebrews 2:14\). You could include that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “In fact, her offspring” or “In fact, one of her descendants”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 3:15

## Genesis 3:15 (#3) (id: 263302)

**"will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel"**

This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “In fact, you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “will crush your head, and you will bruise his heel.”

**"To the woman he said"**

In the Hebrew text, “to the woman” comes first in this sentence, to emphasize her. Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 3:16

## Genesis 3:16 (#3) (id: 263305)

**"in pain you will bear children"**

This clause is the second part of a parallelism, which emphasizes the pain and suffering that women will experience when they bear children. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Alternate translation: “yes you will suffer much pain when you give birth.” or “yes bearing children will be very painful for you.”

## Genesis 3:16 (#4) (id: 263306)

**"Yet your desire {will be} for your husband"**

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom **your desire will be for your husband** are all ambiguous in this context. The text could mean: (1\) “Yet/But you will still desire/long to be with your husband, and he …”, which is similar to what **desire** means in Song of Songs 7:10; or (2\) “Besides that, you will desire/want to control your husband, but he …”, which is similar to what **desire** means in Gen 4:7\. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 3:16

## Genesis 3:16 (#5) (id: 263307)

**"and he will rule over you"**

See how you translated **rule over** in Gen 1:18\. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin. Alternate translation: “and he will control you.” or “and he will lord it over you.”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 3:16

## Genesis 3:17 (#1) (id: 263308)

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 3:17

## Genesis 3:17 (#2) (id: 263309)

**"Since you listened to the voice of your wife"**

The Hebrew text here could mean: (1\) “and make it difficult for you to grow enough crops in the/your fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce enough crops/food to eat.” or (2\) “so that your crops will not grow well and you will have to eat wild plants that grow in the open fields to survive.” That difference of interpretation comes from the fact that the Hebrew word **fields** can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow.

## Genesis 3:19 (#1) (id: 263316)

**""By the sweat of your nose"**

The phrase “by the sweat of your nose/brow” is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. Also, bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for **bread** is used here as an idiom that refers to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food,” especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. Alternate translation: “Only by the sweat of your face will you be able to have enough food to eat,” or “You will have to work hard and sweat a lot in order to have enough food to eat,”

**"Eve"**

If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (**living**), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis.

Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion’s face, a bull’s face and an eagle’s face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14\). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “some powerful beings called cherubim angels”

For example, many translation teams use words for single and double\-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily be in the same verse together.

**"the sons of God"**

The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who **the sons of God** and **the daughters of mankind** refer to: (1\) nonhuman, god\-like (supernatural) beings, such as demons or angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7\) who took human form and married the daughters of human beings (which may be what is referred to in 1 Peter 3:19–20; 2 Peter 2:4, and Jude 6\); or (2\) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line); or (3\) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6\) who married the daughters of common, poor people.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 6:3

## Genesis 6:3 (#4) (id: 263575)

**"because they {are} indeed flesh"**

The word **flesh** is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood. Alternate translation: “because they are very sinful” or “because they are only sinful mortals.”

## Genesis 6:3 (#5) (id: 263576)

**"Therefore their days will be 120 years"**

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1\) “So they will have 120 years to repent.” or “I will give them 120 years to repent.” or (2\) “From now on, they/people will have/live no longer than 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context here of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7\). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32\), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6\); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.

## Genesis 6:4 (#1) (id: 263577)

**"The Nephilim"**

Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word **Nephilim** here, treating it as a name. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other time in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32–33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4\. Alternate translation: “Giants called the Nephilim” or “Giants”

**"from the east"**

At first after the flood, people lived in the regions around the mountains of Ararat (where the ark had landed). As they began to migrate and spread out to different places (as God had told them to do), they must have headed south at some point since they ended up at the plain of Shinar, which was south of where the Ararat Mountains were. The reference to **the east** probably reflects the viewpoint of the author (Moses), since the Ararat mountains and the plain of Shinar were both far to the east of where he was living. Alternate translation: “around in the eastern regions,”

**"And Arpachshad lived thirty\-five years"**

Make sure that your translation of this clause does not mean that Arpachshad only lived to be thirty\-five years old. Also, throughout this chapter, be consistent with how you have decided to handle numbers in the Bible. For example, many translation teams use words for single and double\-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily see the numbers and be in the same verse together.

Your translation needs to allow for the fact that Terah’s sons were not triplets (just as Noah’s sons were not triplets; see Gen 5:32\), rather he started having children after he turned seventy and his sons were born in different years after that. In fact, Abram was not born until Terah was at least 130 years old (11:32, 12:4–5; Acts 7:4\), and he was probably Terah’s youngest son. Abram is listed first (instead of Haran or Nahor) probably because of his importance as the one whom Yahweh made His covenant with. Some of this information could be put in a footnote.

This phrase refers to Abram and his descendants, including ultimately the Messiah.

God blessed all people on earth by sending his Son Jesus (the Messiah/Christ) to die in their place and pay for all their sins (John 3:16–18, 1 Timothy 2:3–6\), so that they could have a close relationship with him/God and be part of his family forever. God repeats this great promise in Genesis 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14\. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

The term **officials** is general and refers to leaders or rulers who were under Pharaoh and served him. Also, the term **Pharaoh** is an Egyptian title that refers to the king or ruler over Egypt. However, in the Old Testament, it is treated as a name (that frequently occurs with the title “king of Egypt”), so translators often transliterate **Pharaoh** (which is how other names in the Bible are normally treated). Some languages require an honorific title with the names of kings, for example, “King Pharaoh”. Decide how you will handle this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Some of the officers who ruled under the Egyptian king spotted her, so” or “When some officials of Pharaoh the king of Egypt saw her,”

**"I raise my hand to Yahweh"**

It was the custom that when a person made an oath, he raised his hand as an appeal to God to witness his oath and to hold him accountable and punish him if he were to break his oath. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “As a witness to this oath, I call on Yahweh”

## Genesis 17:12 (#2) (id: 264716)

**"every male"**

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1\) “and every other male” or “as well as all other males” or (2\) “yes, every male child”. The following context suggests that this phrase includes males of all ages, not just babies, since male slaves who were bought would especially include adult males.

Abimelech uses two rhetorical questions here to express his anger and to scold Abraham for what he had done. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “Why have you treated us like this?” or “What you have done to us is not right!”

## Genesis 20:10 (#1) (id: 265201)

**"Then Abimelech said to Abraham"**

For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same person is still talking to the same person. However, the words emphasize what King Abimelech says next and may indicate that there was a pause between what he said in verse 9 and in verse 10\. Do what is best in your language.

To “fear God” is an important theme in the Bible. It is a complex term that means to recognize how holy and powerful God is and to deeply respect and honor him by obeying and worshiping him. Also, consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Alternate translation: “I thought that there was certainly no one in this place who obeyed God, so I was afraid that they would kill me in order to take my wife for themselves.”

Coins did not exist at that time. Rather people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold shekels, which was a weight measurement. A thousand shekels of silver was about 25 pounds (11\.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote. Alternate translation: “I have given 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother.” or “I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver.”

**"for everyone who had come {to} the gate of his city"**

The pronoun **his** refers back to **everyone** who had gathered at the city gate, not just one person. Also, in that culture, the leaders of a city would hold their meetings at the city gates, where they would make decisions on important matters such as the one Abraham brought before them. You could include that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “including everyone who had gathered there at their city gate,”

## Genesis 23:15 (#3) (id: 265532)

**"Land {worth} 400 shekels of silver"**

Coins did not exist at that time. Rather people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold, which was a weight measurement. Four hundred shekels of silver was about 10 pounds (4\.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote. See how you translated **shekels of silver** in Gen 20:16\. Alternate translation: “The field is worth 400 shekels of silver.” or “If I were selling that land, it would cost 400 shekels of silver.”

This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter.

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here.

Verse 30 is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well (verse 29\). Consider what is the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29–30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets she was wearing and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29–30\.

Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a direct quote or indirect quote here.

The phrase **gathered to his people** is a euphemism that refers to dying but also implies that God took his spirit to be with his ancestors who had already died.

Do what is best your language. Alternate translation: “because he liked to eat the meat of wild deer that he hunted,”

## Genesis 28:9 (#2) (id: 266281)

**"the sister of Nebaioth"**

Be consistent here with how you spelled **Nebaioth** in Gen 25:13\. Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child, Mahalath was his younger sister, probably from the same mother.

## Genesis 29:24 (#1) (id: 266413)

**"And Laban gave"**

It is not clear in the Hebrew text when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah, so it is probably best to keep it that way in your translation. Some translations say that Laban “had already given” Zilpah to Leah before the wedding night. However according to Jewish history (outside the Bible), it was on the wedding night that Laban did this as part of his plan to deceive Jacob: Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, so everyone would expect her to be given to Rachel as the younger sister; seeing Zilpah (instead of Bilhah) would help Jacob think that his veiled bride was Rachel. Since we do not know for sure which interpretation is right, it is probably best to be like the Hebrew text and not specify when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah. Some translations put this verse in parentheses because it seems to interrupt the telling of the main events. Alternate translation: “In addition, Laban gave”

Translate **behold** in a way that shows Jacob’s surprise at finding out that he had married Leah instead of Rachel. Also, make sure that your translation of **she** refers here to Leah, not Zilpah (who was mentioned in verse 24\). Alternate translation: “Jacob saw that his new wife was Leah!” or “Jacob was shocked to discover that it was Leah he had married!”

**"on my knees"**

The idiom **bear children on my knees** means that Bilhah’s children would be considered Rachel’s children. It may come from the custom of immediately putting a newborn child on the lap of the father and mother to symbolize that the child belonged to them. Alternate translation: “for me who will sit on my lap,” or “as my surrogate”

**"Then he said"**

Some translations delete this quote margin, since the same person is still speaking to the same person as in the previous verse. However it could be that there was a pause in the conversation, or the author may want to show that there is a change in topic or emphasize what is said next. So if possible, it is best to keep the quote margin here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Then he said to him,” or “Then Laban added,”

**"every speckled and spotted lamb and every dark\-colored lamb among the sheep"**

The Hebrew word for **speckled** refers to small spots, whereas **spotted** refers to medium\-sized and bigger spots. In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark\-colored goats with light marks and dark\-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “all the lambs that have speckles or spots, or that are dark\-colored,”

The goats were normally dark brown or black, so if they had streaks or spots on them those marks would be white. In the Hebrew text, there is a pun (play\-on\-words) in verses 35 and 37: the name “Laban” means **white**, so verse 35 literally says that any goats with “Laban” (**white**) on them became Jacob’s.

## Genesis 31:53 (#2) (id: 266833)

**"and the gods of Nahor, the gods of their father"**

Abraham trusted in Yahweh, the one and only true God (Gen 15:6\). Terah worshiped other gods (Joshua 24:2\), and so did Laban (verses 19, 30\), which suggests that Nahor served the same gods that his father Terah served, and then taught his son Laban to do the same thing. In spite of that, many translations still capitalize **God** all three times here in verse 53\. Be consistent with how you spelled **Nahor** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 11:22–25, 29; 12:26–27; 22:20, 24, 28; 24:9, 15, 24, 47; 29:5; 31:53\. Alternate translation: “and the gods that my grandfather Nahor and his father Terah worshiped”

A ford is a very shallow place in a stream that is fairly easy and safe for people and animals to walk across. The Jabbok Stream was a small river that flowed from east to west into the Jordan River about halfway between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Jacob took his wives and children from the north side of the stream to the south side; his brother was coming towards them from further south. It might be helpful to include a map here in your translation that includes the places named in this chapter and shows where Jacob and Esau were coming from. Alternate translation: “a shallow place on the Jabbok River.” or “a place in the Jabbok Stream that was shallow.”

**"Then Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she had born for Jacob, went out"**

These events took place at an unspecified time after Jacob and his family set up their camp beside the city of Shechem (Gen 33:18\). Consider what is the best way to introduce a new event in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled **Dinah** in Gen 30:21\. Alternate translation: “Now one day Dinah, who was the daughter whom Leah had for Jacob, went out” or “One day, Dinah, who was the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to the city”

At that time it was normal for parents to negotiate with another family to get a spouse for their child. The negotiations would include a bride\-price and other details. You could put some of that information in a footnote. The term **girl** that Shechem uses here is less respectful than the term “young woman” that is used in verses 3 and 12\.

**"When they heard"**

Many translations put “when they heard” with the previous sentence.

## Genesis 34:7 (#4) (id: 267049)

**"because he had done something disgraceful to Israel"**

Notice in this verse that the Hebrew text has both of Jacob’s names, **Jacob** and “Israel,” to emphasize that Shechem had sinned against Jacob and all of his descendants (the people of Israel). You could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of **Israel** does not refer here to a place, since Israel was not yet a country or a territory.

**"Please give her to him as a wife"**

The way **give** and “take” are used in verses 8, 9, 12, 16 and 21 reflects the culture at that time, when parents or families arranged marriages for their daughters. Also see the note about this at verse 4\. Alternate translation: “So please permit him to marry her.”

## Genesis 34:10 (#2) (id: 267056)

**"And the land is before you. Settle and trade in it"**

Normally foreigners were not allowed to own land or to move around in the land to trade freely. So that is why Hamor is offering this in exchange for Jacob allowing his family to intermarry with the Hivites. Alternate translation: “The land is available for you to choose what you want; settle in it wherever you want. You can also trade freely here,” or “You can settle wherever you want in the land. You can also do business buying and selling things wherever you want,”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 34:11

## Genesis 34:12 (#1) (id: 267060)

**"Increase greatly the dowry and gift for me"**

The **dowry** was the payment that a groom (and his family) had to give to the bride’s family. It could include things like money, land, and livestock. The term **gift** probably refers to additional gifts given to the bride and her family members (as in Gen 24:53\). If the custom of paying a dowry is not known in your culture, you could include an explanation in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Set the dowry and wedding gifts that I must pay to marry her as high as you want,”

**"because they had defiled their sister"**

See how you translated **defiled** in verses 5 and 13\. Even though Shechem was the one who actually defiled Dinah (verses 2, 5, 7, 13\), Jacob’s sons held everyone in the city responsible for the crime that their ruler’s son had committed (verses 25–29\). If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of **they** does not refer to Jacob’s sons. Alternate translation: “They did that because that was where Shechem had disgraced their sister.” or “to get revenge for the shameful thing that had been done to their sister there.”

The idiom **making me stink** means Jacob’s sons had caused him to have a very bad reputation, so that people would hate him and his family. Some languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated **the Canaanites** and **the Perizzites** in Gen 13:7; 15:20–21\.

A drink offering was probably wine that Jacob poured on the stone as a sacrifice to God, to worship and thank him. See how you translated “poured oil on …” in Gen 28:18\. Alternate translation: “Then he poured some wine and some olive oil on the stone pillar to thank God and dedicate the place to him.”

## Genesis 35:16 (#1) (id: 267181)

**"Then they set out from Bethel"**

Be consistent here with how you spelled **Bethel** throughout the book of Genesis and whether you refer to it as a town or a city. See Gen 12:8; 13:3; 28:19; 31:13; 35:1, 3, 7, 15, 16\. Alternate translation: “Then they left the town of Bethel” or “Later Jacob and his family moved on from the town of Bethel”

## Genesis 35:16 (#2) (id: 267182)

**"and there was still a distance of land to come to Ephrath"**

The phrase **a distance of land** is very general, but your translation should not make it sound like the distance was too far, because Rachel’s grave is about two kilometers (one mile) from Ephrath (Bethlehem). Alternate translation: “and started heading toward the town of Ephrath. But while they were still a distance away from there,”

## Genesis 35:17 (#1) (id: 267184)

**"And it happened when she was in hard labor"**

The phrase **hard labor** refers to when childbirth contractions are close together and very painful, often right before a baby is born. Alternate translation: “Then when she was at the most difficult time in her labor,” or “Then when her childbirth pains were the most severe,”

**"Then it happened as her soul was leaving {her}—for she was dying"**

Some translations use an idiom here, for example, “as she was taking her last breath” or “as her life was slipping/fading away”, but it is best to translate this in a way that preserves the biblical teaching that at death the soul or spirit leaves the body. Alternate translation: “But Rachel was dying, and as her soul was leaving her body,” or “But in fact Rachel was about to die, and just before her soul left her,”

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 35:18

## Genesis 35:18 (#2) (id: 267189)

**"then she called his name Ben\-oni"**

The meaning of this name could imply that the child caused Rachel’s death. In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (**Ben\-oni**). Many translations write it that way or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni.” Any of these spellings is fine.

**"Migdal Eder"**

Many translations transliterate **Migdal Eder** (like most other names). Many others translate the meaning of **Migdal** as “the tower” and transliterate “Eder.” A few translate the meaning of the entire name as “the Tower of the Flock.” This was apparently a place near Bethlehem where sheep were raised (Micah 4:8\); shepherds may have watched over their flocks from the tower. Alternate translation: “Eder Tower.”

It may be necessary to translate this word in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Compare that to how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“slave/servant woman”); see Gen 31:33 for a list of where this word occurs in Genesis.

**"These {were} the sons of Seir the Horite who were inhabiting the land"**

The name “Horites” is an alternate name for the Hivites (verse 2\). Also, this genealogy is mentioned here because Seir was the ancestor of Esau’s Canaanite wife Oholibamah (verse 25\) and the Seir mountains where Esau was living (verse 8\) were probably named after Seir.

**"and the sister of Lotan {was} Timna"**

Timna became a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz (verse 12\). This genealogy (verses 20–22\) also shows that she was the daughter of Chief Seir (since her brother Lotan was the son of Chief Seir). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also, according to Jewish history outside the Bible, Timna was Lotan’s younger sister. If your language has a special term for “younger sister” or “older brother,” you could use one of those here. Alternate translation: “and the name of his sister was Timna.”

However, he may have paused between verses 21 and 22 to see the effect of what he said in verse 21\. Also, the repeated quote margin helps emphasize what he says in verse 22\. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Then he added,”

As Joseph’s master, Potiphar still had more authority than Joseph. But he had given Joseph authority to act in his place over everything in his household. Try to make that clear in your translation.

**"Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Rameses"**

It is implied that Rameses (verse 11\) was another name for Goshen (verses 1, 4, 6\). If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them (Exodus 1:11\). Alternate translation: “So Joseph gave his father and his brothers the choicest land in the country of Egypt, and they and their families settled there. The property was in Rameses Count, that is, Goshen County,” or “After that, Joseph helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them the choicest property in Egypt, which was in Goshen Province, also known as Rameses Province.”

Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a conjunction (**Now**) to begin this clause that gives background information about Israel. Also, the word **heavy** is used here as an idiom that means Israel’s eyesight was getting bad, but he could still see some (as indicated in verses 8 and 11\). Many languages have a similar idiom. A translation of verse 10 should not imply that Israel was completely blind. Alternate translation: “Israel had very bad eyesight”

## Genesis 48:14 (#1) (id: 268752)

**"and {he placed} his left hand on the head of Manasseh. He guided his hands"**

In the Hebrew culture, the right side was the place of highest honor and using the right hand to bless someone was symbolic of giving greater honor to that person. The oldest son was also the one who normally received the greater blessing. Israel reverses that here and gives Joseph’s younger son the greater blessing. It may be important to include a footnote in your translation that gives this information.

The word “shepherded” includes guiding, protecting, and providing food and water, such as a shepherd would do for his sheep. Here it is used as a metaphor that refers to God’s complete care of Israel throughout his life. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to use a similar metaphor here. For example, you could say, “He is the same God who, for my entire life, has taken care of all my needs, just as a good shepherd takes care of his sheep.” Alternate translation: “the same God who has watched over me” or “He is the same God who has taken care of me”

**"may he bless {these} boys"**

Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here; your decision will depend on how you translated verse 15\. Also, since Joseph’s sons were probably in their 20s, make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like they were little boys. The Hebrew word for “boy” here can also be translated as “lad,” “servant,” or “young man,” depending on the context and who is speaking to whom. With that in mind, consider again how you translated this word in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:24; 18:7; 19:4; 21:12, 17–20; 22:3, 5, 12, 19; 25:27; 34:19; 37:2; 41:12; 43:8; 44:22, 30–34; 48:16\.

This clause, along with the rest of the verse, is a euphemistic way of referring to Reuben committing adultery by sleeping with his father’s concubine (secondary wife) Bilhah (Genesis 35:22\). Alternate translation: “because you got into my bed with my wife and dishonored me!” or “because you dishonored me by getting into my bed and committing adultery with my concubine”

It was most likely on the west side of the Jordan River, since that is where the cave was located and that is where the Canaanites would have been most likely to observe Joseph’s family and the Egyptians mourning (verse 11\). However, since its location is not certain, it is best to translate **beyond the Jordan** in a general way (like the Hebrew text is).

**"and you must take my bones up from this {place"**

For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “When God does that, you must take my body back to Canaan with you and bury it there.’ Then Joseph made/had his brothers and the rest of the descendants of Israel swear/promise with an oaththat they would do that.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “you must take my bones back to Canaan with you and bury it there.”

(4:4–11)</p></li></ul><h3>What is the book of Jonah about?</h3><p>Jonah, son of Amittai, was a prophet from Gath Hepher, a village in the northern kingdom of Israel (2 Kings 14:25). This book tells about what happened to Jonah. It tells how Yahweh shows mercy and grace to Gentiles. It also tells how the Ninevites repented and called out to Yahweh for mercy. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26012\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Mercy</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25800\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Grace</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26170\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Repent</span>)</p><p>Yahweh sent Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh that he was ready to punish them. Yahweh said that if they would repent he would not harm them. However, Jonah was an Israelite, and he did not want the Ninevites to repent and escape punishment. So Jonah tried to sail away in the opposite direction instead of doing what Yahweh told him to do, but Yahweh stopped him by sending a storm and a large fish to swallow him.</p><p>Jonah repented and warned the Ninevites. As a result, Yahweh taught him that he is concerned about all people, not just the Israelites.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>This book is traditionally titled “The Book of Jonah” or just “Jonah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Book about Jonah.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26805\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">How to Translate Names</span>)</p><h3>Who wrote the book of Jonah?</h3><p>Jonah was probably involved in the writing of this book. However, scholars do not know who actually wrote it.</p><p>Jonah lived in the northern kingdom of Israel, during or before the reign of King Jeroboam II of Israel. He probably prophesied sometime between 800 and 750 B.C.</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>What was the nation of Assyria?</h3><p>During the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient Near East. Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria.</p><p>Assyria was cruel to its enemies. Eventually, Yahweh punished the Assyrians for the wicked things that they did.</p><h3>Did Assyria convert to Judaism?</h3><p>Some scholars think that the Assyrians started worshiping Yahweh alone. However, most scholars think that they continued to worship other false gods, perhaps after a brief time of worshiping Yahweh.

    "content": "<p>Jonah 1 General Notes</p><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>The narrative of this chapter starts abruptly. This is a typical way for a prophetic book to begin. The translator should not add information to smooth this introduction, but the first verse could be made into several sentences to make a more natural beginning. See the UST.</p><h2>Special Concepts in this Chapter</h2><h3>Miracle</h3><p>In verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah1:17\">1:17</a>, there is the mention of “a great fish.” It may be difficult to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole, and we do not know what kind of creature this was. Jonah then survives for three days and nights inside the fish. This is something that God made to happen. Translators should not try to explain miraculous events in an attempt to make them easier to understand. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26022\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Miracle</span>)</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter</h2><h3>Situational irony</h3><p>There is an ironic situation in this chapter. This means that people do or say things that are the opposite of what one would expect them to do. Jonah is a prophet of God, and as such, he would be expected to endeavor to do God’s will. Instead, he runs away from God. Although the Gentile sailors are not Israelites, they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to an almost certain death by throwing him overboard. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26702\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Irony</span>, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26129\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Prophet</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26346\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Willofgod</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25725\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Faith</span>)</p><h3>Sea</h3><p>People in the ancient Near East saw the sea as chaotic, and they did not trust it. Some of the gods they worshiped were gods of the sea. Jonah’s people, the Hebrews, feared the sea greatly. However, Jonah’s fear of the sea was not enough to keep him from sailing on a ship to avoid doing what Yahweh commanded. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25735\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Fear</span>)</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>Implicit information</h3><p>Even though no one knows for sure where Tarshish was, the writer assumes that the reader knows that Jonah had to face away from Nineveh to go there. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26687\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information</span>)</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jonah 2 General Notes</p><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter begins with a prayer by Jonah, and many translators have chosen to set it apart by setting its lines farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Also, the prayer is in the style of poetry. To show that, many translations put each line of the poem on a separate line. Translators can follow these practices, but they are not obligated to do so. You may wish to follow the format of a well-known translation in your area.</p><h2>Special Concepts in this Chapter</h2><h3>Sea</h3><p>This chapter contains many terms that describe the sea. If people who speak your language are unfamiliar with the sea, you will need to discuss how to describe these things. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26822\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Translate Unknowns</span>)</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter</h2><h3>Poetic Imagery</h3><p>Prayers in Scripture are often expressed in poetry. Poetry frequently uses metaphors and other imagery to more powerfully communicate very emotional topics. For example, Jonah thought he would die in a fish in the sea, and so he compares being trapped there as being surrounded by the bars of the earth and being in the “belly of Sheol.” Jonah is overwhelmed by the depth of the sea and expresses this by speaking about being at the “base of the mountains.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>Parallelism</h3><p>Hebrew poetry often expresses something in one line and then expresses that same thought in another line but using different words. This emphasizes the ideas in the parallel lines. For example, verse 2 has two halves that are saying basically the same thing.</p><p>I cried out to Yahweh from my distress, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried out; you heard my voice.</p><p>Each half also has two parts. The first part of each half is saying the same thing as the other, and the second part of each half is also saying the same thing as each other. If your language would not repeat ideas like this in poetry, see: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26713\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Parallelism</span> for ideas for how to translate this kind of poetry.</p>",

    "content": "<p>&quot;# Jonah 3 General Notes</p><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter returns to the narrative about Jonah.</p><h2>Special Concepts in this Chapter</h2><h3>Animals</h3><p>According to the king’s proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast which he had ordered. This was unusual and probably indicates that the king wanted God to see that all of Nineveh was taking his proclamation of destruction very seriously. There is nothing in the law of Moses that instructed the people to have their animals participate in fasting. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25959\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Law of Moses</span>)</p><h3>God Repenting or Relenting</h3><p>The last verse of this chapter says, “So then God relented in regard to the evil that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.” This concept of God changing His mind may seem inconsistent with the fact that God’s character and his plans do not change.</p><p>However, God&apos;s actions of punishment or mercy depend on human actions. God often changes his action from punishment to mercy in response to humans who repent of their sins, because he prefers to be merciful. Because the Ninevites repented, God did not follow through with the judgment that he told Jonah to proclaim, and Jonah described that in a human way as “relenting” or as some versions say, “changing his mind.” The reader understands that this was God’s plan from the beginning.</p><h3>God Planning Evil</h3><p>The Hebrew word translated as “evil” in the ULT is very broad, including moral evil, physical evil, and everything that is bad. So in verse 10, the author uses the same word for God&apos;s planned destruction of Nineveh as he used for the people&apos;s wicked behavior. The ULT translates each of these uses as “evil” to show the user that it is the same Hebrew word in each place. By using the same word, the author is showing that when people repent of moral evil, God relents from doing physical evil (punishment). God never does moral evil. If your language would not use the same word for both of these, you will want to use different words for them.</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>Size of Nineveh</h3><p>The ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh that have been uncovered are about 8 miles or 13 kilometers around. So, although Nineveh was a very big city in the ancient world, it was not as big as most modern cities. The description of Nineveh as “a journey of three days” seems to mean that it took three days to walk through it, although that seems to be more time than would be needed to walk through a city of that size. Of course, it depends on several factors: what a person is doing while on this journey through the city, and that there may have been extensive settlements outside the city walls. Also, the length of time given is probably only a general approximation. Translators should simply translate the text and not try to reconcile it with what modern archeologists think that they know about ancient Nineveh and the people who walked through it.</p><h3>A City Great to God</h3><p>Verse three in the ULT describes Nineveh as “a city great to God.” In Hebrew, saying that something is &quot;&quot;to God&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;of God&quot;&quot; is an idiom that means that it is an extreme example of that thing. For example, in Genesis 30:8, Rachel describes the struggle she has had with her sister as “a struggle of God,” meaning “a mighty struggle” or “an extremely difficult struggle.” Other examples of this idiom in the Bible are found in Genesis 23:6, Exodus 9:28, 1 Samuel 14:15, Psalms 36:6, and Psalms 80:10. In Jonah 3:3, this idiom probably means that Nineveh was an extremely large city. See how this is translated in the Bible that is most commonly used in your area. You may want to follow how they translated this idiom.</p><p>&quot;</p>",

    "content": "<p>Jonah 4 General Notes</p><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>Jonah continues the narrative and brings the book to an unusual conclusion, ending it with a question from God. This emphasizes that the book is not really about Jonah. It is about God’s desire to be merciful to everyone, whether Jew or Gentile. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26012\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Mercy</span>)</p><h2>Special Concepts in this Chapter</h2><h3>Prophecy delayed</h3><p>According to the law of Moses, a prophet must prophesy what Yahweh tells him to prophesy, and his words must come true. If that did not happen, the penalty was death, because that unfulfilled prophecy shows that the man was not a real prophet. But when Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in 40 days, it did not happen at that time. This is because God reserves the right to be merciful. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26129\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Prophet</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25959\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Law of Moses</span>)</p><h3>Jonah’s anger</h3><p>When God did not destroy Nineveh, Jonah was angry with God because Jonah hated the people of Nineveh. They were enemies of Israel. But God wanted Jonah and the readers of this book to learn that God loves all people.</p><h3>Characteristics of God</h3><p>In verse 2, Jonah attributes a series of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as the description that God used about himself when speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai (See <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7\">Exodus 34:6–7</a>).</p><h3>God’s grace</h3><p>When Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot; God graciously provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah that he is a merciful God through this object lesson. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25800\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Grace</span>)</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter</h2><h3>Rhetorical questions</h3><p>In this chapter, Jonah uses a rhetorical question to show how angry he is at Yahweh. Yahweh then uses a series of three rhetorical questions to teach Jonah about the attitude that he should have. If your language would not use rhetorical questions for these purposes, then use a more natural form. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26724\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Rhetorical Question</span>)</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>Evil</h3><p>The Hebrew word translated as “evil” in the ULT is very broad, including moral evil, physical evil, and everything that is bad. God never does moral evil. In verse 1, the author says that Jonah considered God&apos;s act of mercy in sparing the people of Nineveh to be evil. In verse 2, Jonah describes God as “relenting from evil.” In verse 6, Jonah&apos;s situation and attitude are described as evil. This is after the actions of the Ninevites are described as evil in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah1:2\">1:2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah3:8\">3:8</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah3:10\">3:10</a>, and the situation of the sailors in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah1:7\">1:7</a>. The ULT translates the word as “evil” in each place to show the irony that the author wants to convey by using the same Hebrew word for each different bad thing in the book and for one good thing—God&apos;s mercy on Nineveh (from Jonah&apos;s perspective). If your language would not use the same word for both moral and physical evil, you will want to use different words for each of them.</p>",

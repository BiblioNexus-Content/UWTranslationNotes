    "content": "<h1>Introduction to Haggai</h1><h2>Part 1: General Introduction</h2><h3>What is the book of Haggai about?</h3><p>In 539 B.C., the Persian emperor Cyrus conquered the Babylonian empire. He permitted peoples whom the Babylonians had exiled to return to their homelands. So the next year, a group of Israelites from the former kingdom of Judah returned home from exile. Within two years, they began to repair Yahweh’s temple in Jerusalem. But after they had only laid the foundation, their enemies forced them to stop. However, around 520 B.C. a new king, Darius, became emperor of Persia, and he was likely to allow the Judeans to finish rebuilding the temple. Nevertheless, they neglected that work and built luxurious homes for themselves instead. In response, Yahweh prevented their crops from growing well, and the people became hungry and poor. Yahweh then sent the prophet Haggai to explain to them that he had done this because they had neglected his temple. Through Haggai, Yahweh promised that if they would rebuild his temple, he would bless them once again with abundant crops. Yahweh also promised their governor, Zerubbabel, that he would make him an honored leader among the nations of the world. The people responded to Haggai’s prophesies by obeying Yahweh and rebuilding his temple, and Yahweh blessed them once again.</p><h3>Outline of Haggai</h3><p>The book of Haggai consists of four oracles that Yahweh gave him to deliver to the Judeans who had returned from exile. Each oracle is dated on a particular day of a specific month in the second year of the reign of Darius as emperor of Persia.</p><ul><li><p>First oracle (1:1–15a): The people must finish the temple so that Yahweh will bless them again</p></li><li><p>Second oracle (1:15b–2:9): The rebuilt temple will be more glorious than the first temple</p></li><li><p>Third oracle (2:10–19): Yahweh has withheld crops, but now he will bless the people</p></li><li><p>Fourth oracle (2:20–23): Yahweh will defeat the nations and establish Zerubbabel as his honored ruler</p></li></ul><h3>Who was the prophet Haggai?</h3><p>The book of Haggai does not tell us very much about the prophet whose oracles it records. Haggai is mentioned briefly in one other book of the Bible. Ezra 5:1 tells us that Haggai “prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.” Ezra 6:14 adds that “the elders of the Jews were building and prospering by the prophesying of Haggai the prophet” and that “they built and completed” the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem. But we know nothing beyond this. Still, we can recognize that Haggai must have been a man of faith, courage, and conviction to challenge the Judeans in their comfortable complacency and inspire them to renew the work of rebuilding the temple.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>This book traditionally has been titled “Haggai” or “The Book of Haggai.” Translators may also decide to give it a title such as “The Prophecies of Haggai” or “The Sayings of Haggai”</p><h2>Part 2: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>Hebrew months</h3><p>The book of Haggai dates each of its four oracles by the day of a Hebrew month. In your translation, you could convert these Hebrew days and months into approximate dates on the calendar that your culture uses. Notes will give equivalents on Western calendars for those who wish to do this. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will often not be accurate. So it may be preferable to state the number of the day and the name of the month of the Hebrew calendar in the text of your translation and say in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.</p><h3>Quote marks</h3><p>The oracles of Haggai are direct first-level quotations from Yahweh. They contain second-level and third-level quotations. If you decide to present those as direct quotations, you can indicate their beginnings and endings with second-level and third-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off these quotations. Alternatively, if your language would not put direct quotations inside a direct quotation, you could represent the second-level and third-level quotations as indirect quotations. Notes suggest how you could do this in various places.</p><h3>“The declaration of Yahweh”</h3><p>Haggai frequently uses the formula “the declaration of Yahweh” to identify his oracles as words that Yahweh has given him to speak. If your language would not use an abstract noun such as “declaration,” you could express the same idea in another way. You might say, for example, “this is what Yahweh declares.”</p><h3>“House” meaning “temple”</h3><p>Throughout the book of Haggai, various speakers use the word “house” to mean “temple.” They are speaking of the temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could state the meaning plainly and say “temple” rather than “house” in each of these instances.</p><h3>Singular and plural “you”</h3><p>Throughout the book, the words “you,” “yourselves,” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperatives are all plural because Yahweh is addressing the returned exiles as a group. The only exception is in the last verse, where “you” is singular because Yahweh is speaking to Zerubbabel alone. So if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use plural forms throughout your translation except in the last verse, where the singular form is appropriate.</p><h3>The date formula of the second oracle</h3><p>In 1:1 and 2:10, the first and third oracles in the book are dated with a day, month, and year. It may therefore be that the reference to a year in 1:19, “in the second year of Darius the king,” is actually part of the dating of the second oracle, which follows immediately afterwards in the text, although after a chapter and verse division. Some versions begin a new sentence with that phrase in order to put the information about the “second year” with the information in 2:1 about the “seventh month” and the “twenty-first day.” Some versions also put a section heading before “In the second year” to suggest that a new oracle is starting with that phrase. Other versions place the chapter and verse division before “In the second year of Darius the king,” which makes that phrase part of 2:1. (The chapter and verse divisions in the Bible were added many centuries after the Bible was written, as an aid to locating passages within the Bible. Subsequently, some translators and publishers have made various adjustments to the placement of chapter and verse divisions.) In your translation, present the material in the way that you feel will be most helpful to your readers.

The ULT does this with the poetry in verses 6–7 and 21–22.</p><h2>Translation Issues in this Chapter</h2><h3>The teaching example of uncleanness (verses 12–14)</h3><p>In the third oracle, Yahweh has Haggai speak with the priests in front of the people in order to teach the people by using an example. Haggai has the priests confirm that a person in a state of holiness does not communicate that holy state to foods that he touches. Haggai then has the priests confirm that a person in a state of uncleanness does communicate that unclean state to foods that he touches. Haggai then tells the people that Yahweh considers them to be unclean, meaning not in a proper state to take part in worship, because they have not obeyed him and rebuilt the temple. They have communicated that unclean state to the foods that they have offered in sacrifice, and so those sacrifices are not acceptable to Yahweh. Stated plainly, the message of this example is that the sacrifices the people are offering on the altar do not make up for their disobedience in not rebuilding the temple. Rather, their disobedience in not rebuilding the temple is making their sacrifices unacceptable. Notes to verses 11–14 will suggest ways in which you can indicate this meaning in your translation.</p>",

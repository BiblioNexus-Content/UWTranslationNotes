## 1 John - Introduction (id: 700149)

Introduction to 1 John
======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of the book of 1 John

This is a letter that the apostle John wrote to challenge and correct false teachings that were leading followers of Jesus to believe wrong things and live in wrong ways. John used the normal letter form of that time, which had distinct opening and closing sections with the main body of the letter in between them.

1. Opening of Letter (1:1–4\)
2. Main Body of Letter (1:5–5:12\)

    * Genuine believers obey God and love one another (1:5–2:17\)
        * It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Messiah (2:18–2:27\)
        * Genuine children of God do not sin (2:28–3:10\)
        * Genuine believers help one another sacrificially (3:11–18\)
        * Genuine believers have confidence in prayer (3:19–24\)
        * It is false teaching to deny that Jesus became human (4:1–6\)
        * Genuine believers love one another as God has loved them (4:7–21\)
        * It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Son of God (5:1–12\)
3. Closing of Letter (5:13–21\)

### Who wrote the book of 1 John?

The author of this letter does not give his name. However, since early Christian times, the church has widely considered the apostle John to be the author. He wrote the Gospel of John, and there are many similarities between the content of that book and this letter. If John did write this letter, he probably did so near the end of his life.

### To whom was the book of 1 John written?

The author wrote this letter to people whom he addresses as “beloved” and as “my little children.” This probably refers to believers in various churches located in the area where John was then living.

### What is the book of 1 John about?

False teachers were encouraging followers of Jesus to believe wrong things and to live in wrong ways. John wanted to challenge and correct those false teachings so that the people who received his letter would continue to believe the truth that they had been taught and live in right ways. The false teachers were saying that these people were not saved; John wanted to assure them that they were saved.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 John” or “First John.” They may also choose a different title, such as “The First Letter from John” or “The First Letter John Wrote.” (See: How to Translate Names)

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### Who were the people against whom John spoke?

The false teachers whom John was challenging seem to have held beliefs similar to what would later become known as Gnosticism. Those false teachers believed that the physical world was evil. They thought that God would not become human, since they considered the physical body to be evil, so they denied that in the person of Jesus, God had come to earth in human form. (See: Evil)

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### “sin”

In chapter 1, John says that we should not deny that we sin. Rather, if we confess our sin, God will forgive us. In chapter 2, John says that he is writing this letter so that the recipients will not sin, but he adds that if they do sin, Jesus will advocate on their behalf. But in chapter 3, John says that everyone who has been begotten from God and who remains in God does not commit sin and is not able to sin. And in chapter 5, John says that we should not pray for people who are sinning in certain ways, although we should pray for people who are sinning in other ways. These ideas may seem confusing and contradictory.

However, the explanation is that the people whose teachings John challenged and corrected in this letter were saying that it did not matter what people did in their bodies. This was because they thought that physical matter was evil, and so they thought that God did not care about it. In effect, they were saying that there was no such thing as sin. So John needed to say, in chapter 1, that sin is real and that everyone sins and that God does care about that. So when believers sin they need to confess it and for God to forgive them. Some of the believers may have been deceived by the false teaching and may have begun living sinfully again, so John also needed to reassure them that if they repented and confessed their sins, God would forgive them. John says similar things in chapter 2\. Then in chapter 3 he explains that the new nature that believers have as children of God is one that rejects sin. A believer does not want to sin and does not enjoy sinning. They should recognize that those who excuse or condone sin are not truly children of God, and that as children of God themselves, God helps them to become more and more obedient and free from sin. Finally, in chapter 5, John warns that if a person sins wantonly and continually, this likely means that they have rejected Jesus and are not influenced by the Holy Spirit. He says that, in that case, it may not be effective to pray for them. But he then encourages his readers that if a person sins occasionally but feels remorse, he is influenced by the Spirit, and so the prayers of other believers will help him to repent and to live in a right way again. (See: Sin and Faith and Forgive)

### “remain”

In this letter, John often uses the word “remain” (which could also be translated as “reside” or “abide”) as a spatial metaphor. John speaks of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if the teaching of Jesus “remained” in the believer. He speaks of a person being spiritually joined to someone else as if that person “remained” in the other person: He writes that Christians “remain” in Christ and in God, and he says that the Father “remains” in the Son, the Son “remains” in the Father, the Son “remains” in believers, and the Holy Spirit “remains” in believers.

Translators may find it difficult to represent these ideas in their own languages if they try to use exactly the same words and expressions each time. For example, in [2:6](https://ref.ly/1John2:6), when John speaks of a believer “remaining” in God, he intends to express the idea of that believer being spiritually unified with God. Accordingly, the UST speaks of how the believer “shares life with God.” To give another example, for the statement in [2:14](https://ref.ly/1John2:14) that “the word of God remains in you,” the UST says, “you continue to obey what God commands.” This shows how other expressions can be found that accurately communicate the various ideas that John is expressing through the term “remain.”

### “appear”

In several places in this letter, John uses a term that the ULT usually translates as “appear.” This is actually a passive verbal form in Greek, but as is often the case with such forms in that language, it can have an active meaning. When it has an active meaning, it is important to recognize that it does not simply mean “seemed to be there,” as the word “appeared” might suggest. Rather, it means “came to be there.” This is illustrated well by the use of the term in another New Testament book, 2 Corinthians, in which Paul writes in [5:10](https://ref.ly/1John5:10) that “we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.” Clearly this does not mean that we must only seem to be present there. Rather, we must actually arrive there.

Throughout the letter, it is a subtle matter of interpretation to decide whether John is using the term “appear” in an active sense or in a passive sense. For example, in [1:2](https://ref.ly/1John1:2), John applies the term twice to the “Word of life,” that is, to Jesus. But it is not clear whether he is saying that Jesus himself “appeared,” that is, he came to earth, or that he “was made apparent” (made visible), with the emphasis on the idea that God revealed Jesus to the world and in the process revealed himself to the world through Jesus. At each place where John uses this term, notes will call attention to it and discuss what it likely means in that context.

### “the world”

John also uses the term “world” in a variety of senses in this letter. It can mean the earth, something material, the people who live in the world, the people who do not honor God, or the values of the people who do not honor God. Notes will address the meaning of the term “world” in each instance where John uses it.

### “to know”

The verb “to know” is used in two different ways in this letter. Sometimes it is used about knowing a fact, as in 3:2, 3:5, and 3:19\. Sometimes it means to experience and understand someone or something, as in 3:1, 3:6, 3:16, and 3:20\. Sometimes John uses it in two different senses in the same sentence, as in 2:3, “in this we know that we have known him.” Your language may have different words for these different meanings. If so, you must be careful to use the appropriate word in the right place in your translation.

### “We”

In most cases in this letter, the first\-person plural pronouns (“we, our,” etc.) are inclusive, and so if your language marks that distinction, use the inclusive form in your translation. In those cases, John is speaking of what both he and the recipients know, or of things that are true of both him and the recipients. However, in a few cases, the first\-person pronouns are exclusive, since John is telling the recipients what he and his fellow apostles saw and heard from Jesus. The notes will identify all such places, and in them you should use the exclusive forms if your language marks that distinction. (See: Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’)

### “You, your”

The words “you” and “your” in this letter are plural.

### Light and darkness

In 1:5–7 and 2:8–11 John uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is good or holy and darkness represents what is evil. If this is not easily understood in your language, you may need to say explicitly that light represents goodness or that light is like goodness, or you may choose to talk about goodness without using the symbol of light. There will be a note explaining the metaphor in each place. (See: Biblical Imagery — Extended Metaphors)

### Major textual issues in the book of 1 John

When ancient manuscripts of the Bible differ, the ULT puts the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate in its text, but it puts other possibly accurate readings in footnotes. The introductions to each chapter will discuss places where the ancient manuscripts differ in significant ways, and notes will address those places again where they occur in the book. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the readings found in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the readings in the ULT text.

Important Translation Issues in this Chapter
--------------------------------------------

### The Word of Life

John uses the phrase “the Word of life” to refer to Jesus in [1:1](https://ref.ly/1John1:1). "The Word" is a title that John uses for Jesus. If you have translated the beginning of the Gospel of John, see how you translated it there. This title does not refer to a word that is spoken by someone. By using this title for Jesus, John is saying that Jesus is God’s most important message to all people. Jesus is the one who reveals who God is. In your translation of this title, try to make it clear that this is the title of a person whose role it is to communicate a message. Something like “The Message” or “The Revealer” might be appropriate. Consider also the title that is used in an accepted translation in your area. Here, John connects the title "the Word" with the phrase "of life." By this, John probably means that Jesus reveals God to the world and that Jesus also is the source of life. A translation of this entire phrase could be something like, "Jesus, the Message of God who gives life." (See: Word of God)

### Order of Information

Like many Greek compositions of this time, for stylistic purposes, this letter begins with a very long sentence. It goes from the beginning of [1:1](https://ref.ly/1John1:1) to the middle of [1:3](https://ref.ly/1John1:3). The parts of this sentence may not be in the order that is customary in many languages. The direct object comes first, and it is very long, made up of many different clauses. The subject and verb do not come until near the end. And in the middle, there is a long digression. So think about the best way to translate and arrange the parts of this sentence in your language.

One approach that might work well in your language would be to create a verse bridge that includes all of 1:1–3\. You could break up this long sentence into several smaller sentences, repeating the subject and verb for clarity. This would allow you to present the parts of the sentence in an order that might be more customary in your language and that your readers might understand better. Here is an example of 1 John 1:1–3 rearranged into an order that might be clearer in your language:

“We want you to have fellowship with us, and also with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. Therefore, we are declaring to you what we have seen and heard. We are declaring to you what was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched. It has to do with the Word of life. Indeed, the life appeared, and we have seen it, and we are testifying to it. Yes, we are announcing to you the eternal life that was with the Father and that then came to us.”

If you take this approach, another way to translate a combination of the second and third sentences would be, “So we are declaring to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and what our hands have touched.”

Another approach that could also work well and which would not require a verse bridge would be to leave the phrases in their present order, but to divide the sentence into three parts at the verse divisions. If you do that, you could also put your translation of the phrase “regarding the Word of life” at the beginning rather than the end of [1:1](https://ref.ly/1John1:1) and present it as a topical introduction to the letter. Otherwise, your readers might not get the sense that this is a letter until they reached [1:4](https://ref.ly/1John1:4), where John formally states his purpose for writing. An example of 1 John 1:1–3 in this order would be:

“1 This is about the Word of life. This Word was from the beginning. We have heard him, we have seen him with our eyes, we have looked at him and our hands have touched him. 2 Indeed, this one who is life appeared, and we have seen him, and we are testifying about him. Yes, we are announcing to you the eternal life that was with the Father and that then came to us. 3 We are declaring to you what we have seen and heard so that you will have fellowship with us, and this fellowship is also with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.”

The notes to [1:1–4](https://ref.ly/1John1:1-1John1:4) provide further specific suggestions for how to translate this long opening sentence. (See: Verse Bridges)

Important Textual Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------------

In [1:4](https://ref.ly/1John1:4), the most accurate ancient manuscripts read “so that our joy may be fulfilled.” The ULT follows that reading. However, some other ancient manuscripts read, “your joy” instead of “our joy.” If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: Textual Variants)

## 1 John 1:1 (#1) (id: 256342)

**""**

If you are using section headings, you could put one here before verse 1\. Suggested heading: “The Word of Life”

See:

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:1

## 1 John 1:1 (#2) (id: 256343)

**"What was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched, regarding the Word of life"**

See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter for how to translate the long sentence in [1:1–3](https://ref.ly/1John1:1-1John1:3). If you follow the suggestion to translate the phrase **regarding the Word of life** as a topical introduction to this letter, you will already have indicated that the four clauses in this verse refer to a person, Jesus. If you have pronouns in your language that refer to people, such as “he,” “who,” and “whom,” it would be appropriate to use them here. Alternate translation: “Regarding the Word of life—he is the one who has existed from all eternity, whom we heard speak, whom we saw with our own eyes, and whom we looked at and touched with our own hands”

## 1 John 1:1 (#3) (id: 256344)

**"from the beginning"**

John uses the phrase **from the beginning** in various ways in this letter. Here it refers to the fact that Jesus has always existed. Alternate translation: “from all eternity”

**"we have heard,"** \- **"we have seen"** \- **"our"** \- **"we have looked at"** \- **"our"**

Here the pronouns **we** and **our** are exclusive, since John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, but the people to whom he is writing did not see Jesus. So use exclusive forms here if your language marks that distinction.

See: Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’

## 1 John 1:1 (#5) (id: 256346)

**"which we have heard"**

The implication is that what John and the other eyewitnesses **heard** was Jesus speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include this information, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “whom we heard speak”

## 1 John 1:1 (#6) (id: 256347)

**"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at"**

These two phrases mean the same thing. John is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases and show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “whom we saw clearly ourselves”

## 1 John 1:1 (#7) (id: 256348)

**"which we have seen with our eyes"**

In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, your language may have its own way of using such extra information for emphasis, and you could also do that in your translation. Alternate translation: “whom we saw” or “whom we saw with our own eyes”

**"our hands have touched"**

In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, your language may have its own way of using such extra information for emphasis, and you could also do that in your translation. Alternate translation: “whom we touched” or “whom we touched with our own hands”

## 1 John 1:1 (#9) (id: 256350)

**"we have seen with our eyes,"** \- **"our hands have touched"**

The false teachers were denying that Jesus was a real human being and saying that he was only a spirit. But the implications of what John is saying here are that Jesus was a real human being. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, as in the UST.

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:1 (#10) (id: 256351)

**"regarding the Word of life"**

As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, you could put your translation of this phrase, **regarding the Word of life**, at the beginning of this verse and present it as a sentence of its own as a topical introduction to the letter, as UST does. Alternate translation: “This is about Jesus, the Word of life”

* **Associated Articles:** Information Structure (ID: `33286@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:1 (#11) (id: 256352)

**"regarding the Word of life"**

Letter writers of this time typically began by giving their own names. That is the case for most of the letters in the New Testament. This letter is an exception, but if it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply John’s name here, as UST does. As noted above, John uses the plural pronoun “we” because he is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to Jesus’ earthly life. But it may be more natural in your language for him to refer to himself with a singular pronoun, and if so, you could also do that in your translation, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “This is John, writing to you about Jesus, the Word of life”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:1 (#12) (id: 256353)

**"the Word of life"**

Here, **the Word of life** is implicitly a description of Jesus. As the General Introduction explains, there are many similarities between this letter and the Gospel of John. That gospel begins by saying about Jesus, “In the beginning was the Word.” So when John speaks in this letter of **the Word of life** that **was from the beginning**, he is also speaking about Jesus. ULT indicates this by capitalizing **Word** to indicate that this is a title for Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus, the Word of God, who gives life”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:1 (#13) (id: 256354)

**"of life"**

This could be referring either to the **life** that Jesus has or to the life that Jesus gives. But since John is writing this letter to reassure believers, it seems more likely that this expression is referring to the **life** that “the Word” (Jesus) gives to those who believe. Alternate translation: “who gives life to everyone who believes in him”

## 1 John 1:1 (#14) (id: 256355)

**"of life"**

In this letter, John uses **life** in different ways, either to refer literally to physical life or to spiritual life. Here the reference is to spiritual life. Alternate translation: “of spiritual life”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:2 (#1) (id: 256356)

**"indeed, the life appeared"**

See the discussion of the term “appear” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. Here the term could mean one of two things. (1\) John could be emphasizing how Jesus came to this earth. (See the UST.) It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Indeed, the life came right here” (2\) John could be emphasizing how God revealed Jesus to the world and thereby revealed himself to the world through Jesus. To bring out that emphasis, you could translate this with a passive verbal form or, if your language does not use passive forms, you can use an active form and say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Indeed, the life was made visible” or “Indeed, God made the life visible”

## 1 John 1:2 (#2) (id: 256357)

**"the life"**

John is speaking of Jesus, whom he calls the “Word of life” in the previous verse, by referring to **the life** that is associated with him. In this case it seems to describe the **life** that Jesus embodies rather than the **life** that he gives. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “Jesus, who is life”

## 1 John 1:2 (#3) (id: 256358)

**"we have seen {it},"** \- **"we are testifying {to it},"** \- **"we are announcing"** \- **"to us"**

John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, so the pronouns **we** and **us** are exclusive in this verse.

## 1 John 1:2 (#4) (id: 256359)

**"to you"**

As the General Introduction explains, John is writing this letter to believers in various churches, and so the pronouns **you**, “your,” and “yourselves” are plural throughout the entire letter.

**"we have seen {it}, and we are testifying {to it"**

If you decided to use personal pronouns in [1:1](https://ref.ly/1John1:1), you could use them in these cases as well. Alternate translation: “we have seen him, and we are testifying that we saw him”

**"we are testifying {to it}, and we are announcing to you"**

## 1 John 1:2 (#7) (id: 256362)

## 1 John 1:3 (#1) (id: 256365)

**"what we have seen and heard, we declare also to you, so that you also may have fellowship with us"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the parts of this section. You could move the clause beginning with **so that you also** to the beginning of the verse, since that clause gives the reason for the action that the rest of the verse describes. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “So that you also may have fellowship with us, we are declaring to you what we have seen and heard”

## 1 John 1:3 (#2) (id: 256366)

**"what we have seen and heard"**

John is referring implicitly to the way that he and the other eyewitnesses had **seen and heard** Jesus when he was alive on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include this information, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “what we saw and heard from Jesus when he was alive on earth”

## 1 John 1:3 (#3) (id: 256367)

**"we have seen and heard, we declare"** \- **"us"**

John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, so the pronouns **we** and **us** are exclusive.

## 1 John 1:3 (#4) (id: 256368)

**"you also may have fellowship with us."** \- **"our fellowship {is} with the Father and with his Son"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **fellowship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that you could be close friends with us … we are all close friends with God the Father and with his Son”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:3 (#5) (id: 256369)

**"our fellowship {is} with"**

The word **our** here is likely inclusive, since John is writing to fellow believers. So if your language marks that distinction, you should translate the term as inclusive. Even if your language does not mark that distinction, you can indicate in your translation that the term applies both to John and to the people to whom he is writing. Alternate translation: “we are all close friends with”

## 1 John 1:4 (#1) (id: 256371)

**"we are writing these things"**

As the General Notes to this chapter explain, here John is formally stating his purpose for writing. If you decided in [1:1](https://ref.ly/1John1:1) that it would be more natural in your language for him to refer to himself with a singular pronoun in such a context, you could do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing these things”

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:4 (#2) (id: 256372)

**"we"** \- **"our"**

If you use the plural pronoun **we** here, it would be exclusive, since John is speaking of himself and the other eyewitnesses on whose behalf he is writing. However, the term **our** in the second clause is likely inclusive, since John probably means that he wants both himself and his readers to have **joy** in the shared fellowship with one another and with the Father and the Son whom he describes in the previous verse.

## 1 John 1:4 (#3) (id: 256373)

**"our joy"**

See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to follow the reading of ULT and say **our joy** or to follow the reading of some other versions and say “your joy.”

* **Associated Articles:** Textual Variants (ID: `33405@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:4 (#4) (id: 256374)

**"our joy"**

If you follow the variant reading “your joy” here instead of **our joy**, the word “your” would be plural, as in the rest of this letter, since it would refer to a group of believers.

See: Forms of You

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of You (ID: `33317@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:4 (#5) (id: 256375)

**"so that our joy may be fulfilled"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that we will be completely happy”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:4 (#6) (id: 256376)

## 1 John 1:4 (#7) (id: 256377)

**"so that our joy may be fulfilled"**

The implications are that John and his readers will be completely happy together if his readers recognize the truth of what he is writing to them about. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, as UST does.

## 1 John 1:5 (#4) (id: 256381)

**"God is light, and darkness is not in him at all"**

These two phrases mean similar things. John is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “God is entirely light” or, if you represent these metaphors plainly (See: next two notes), “God is completely holy”

## 1 John 1:5 (#5) (id: 256382)

**"God is light"**

John often uses **light** in this letter to mean what is holy, right, and good. Here, in reference to God, it indicates holiness. Alternate translation: “God is holy”

* **Associated Passages:** 1JN 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 1:5 (#7) (id: 256384)

**"darkness is not in him at all"**

John is using a double negative in Greek for emphasis. In English it would translate as “darkness is not in him not at all.” In Greek, the second negative does not cancel the first negative to create a positive meaning. In English, the meaning would inaccurately be positive, which is why ULT uses only one negative and says “darkness is not in him at all.” But if your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction in your translation.

**"If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we are lying and we are not doing the truth"**

## 1 John - Chapter 2 Introduction (id: 700151)

1 John 2 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

1. Genuine believers obey God and love one another (2:1–17, continuing from 1:5\)
2. It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Messiah (2:18–2:27\)
3. Genuine children of God do not sin (2:28–29, continues through 3:10\)

In order to show that John is writing something like poetry in [2:12–14](https://ref.ly/1John2:12-1John2:14), some translations set the statements in those verses farther to the right than the rest of the text, and they begin a new line at the start of each statement.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Antichrist

In [2:18](https://ref.ly/1John2:18) and [2:22](https://ref.ly/1John2:22), John writes both about a specific person called the Antichrist and about many people who will be “antichrists.” The word “antichrist” means “opposed to Christ.” The Antichrist is a person who will come just before the return of Jesus and imitate Jesus’ work, but he will do that for evil purposes. Before that person comes, there will be many other people who work against Christ. They too are called “antichrists,” but as a description rather than as a name. (See: Antichrist and Lastday and Evil)

Important Textual Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------------

In [2:20](https://ref.ly/1John2:20), some ancient manuscripts read “you all know,” and that is the reading that ULT follows. However, other ancient manuscripts read “you know all things.” It seems more likely, based on everything else in the letter, that “you all know” is the correct original reading, since John is countering the claim of false teachers to know more than other believers. The reading “you know all things” seems to have arisen because copyists felt a need to have an object for the verb “know.” Nevertheless, if a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: Textual Variants)

## 1 John 2:1 (#1) (id: 256418)

**"My little children"**

Here and in several other places in the book, John uses the diminutive form of the word **children** as an affectionate form of address. The ULT shows this by adding the word **little**. If your language has diminutive forms, you may wish to use one here. You could also express the meaning of the diminutive as a term of endearment. Alternate translation: “My dear children”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 2:1 (#2) (id: 256419)

**"My little children"**

John is using the word **children** to describe the believers to whom he is writing, even though they are adults. They are under his spiritual care, and so he regards them in that sense as if they were his own children. You could translate this plainly, or you could represent the metaphor as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “You dear believers who are under my care”

**"Beloved"**

**Beloved** is another term of affection by which John addresses the believers to whom he is writing.

See the Gospel of John [13:34](https://ref.ly/1John13:34) and [15:12](https://ref.ly/1John15:12). John indicates this explicitly in this letter in [3:23](https://ref.ly/1John3:23) and [4:21](https://ref.ly/1John4:21).

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 John 2:8 (#2) (id: 256468)

**"I am writing a new commandment to you"**

John is referring to the same **commandment** as in [2:7](https://ref.ly/1John2:7), the commandment that Jesus gave to love one another, which the believers have had all along. So he does not mean that he is now writing a **new** and different commandment, but rather that this same commandment, which he called “old” there, can also be considered **new** in a certain sense. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly which **commandment** John is referring to, and you could give the likely reason why it can be considered **new** as well as “old.” Alternate translation: “the commandment that I am writing to you, to love one another, is also, in a sense, a new commandment, because it is characteristic of a new way of life”

**"which is true in him and in you"**

Since Jesus consistently obeyed the commandment to love, it is likely that John is emphasizing that believers are doing the same thing themselves.

**"the darkness is going away, and the true light is already shining"**

As in [1:5](https://ref.ly/1John1:5), John is using the word **darkness** to represent evil and the word **light** to represent what is holy, right, and good.

**"little children"**

The term **little children** here could refer to: (1\) all of the believers to whom John is writing. This is the way that he uses this term in [2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1) and in several other places in this letter. See the explanation of it in two of the notes to [2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1). If that is the sense, then John divides the believers into only two groups in verses 12–14, the older ones and the younger ones. See the UST. Or it could refer to: (2\) only some of the believers. In that case, John is addressing the believers in three different groups in verses 12–14, and this group would represent new believers, that is, those who have very recently put their faith in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins. This would also apply to the similar term in [2:14](https://ref.ly/1John2:14). Alternate translation: “new believers”

## 1 John 2:14 (#1) (id: 256509)

**"I have written to you, young children, because you know the Father"**

This sentence is similar to the sentence in [2:12](https://ref.ly/1John2:12). The next two sentences in this verse mean basically the same thing as the two sentences in [2:13](https://ref.ly/1John2:13). John is using these repetitions for emphasis and for poetic effect. For those reasons, it would be appropriate to translate all of these sentences separately and not combine them with the ones in the previous two verses, even if you combine parallel statements with similar meanings elsewhere in the book.

## 1 John 2:14 (#2) (id: 256510)

**"I have written to you, young children, because you know the Father"**

In some Bibles, this sentence comes at the end of [2:13](https://ref.ly/1John2:13) instead of at the beginning of this verse. The verse divisions were introduced to the Bible many centuries after its books were written, and their purpose is only to help readers find things easily. So the placement of this sentence, either at the start of this verse or at the end of the previous one, does not create any significant difference in meaning. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the placement in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the placement in the ULT text.

## 1 John 2:14 (#3) (id: 256511)

**"I have written to you"**

By saying **I have written**, John is expressing himself slightly differently than in [2:12–13](https://ref.ly/1John2:12-1John2:13), where he says, “I am writing.” The difference is likely only for emphasis, as John looks back at what he has just said and indicates that he is saying it again. However, if your language distinguishes between the present and present perfect tenses, it would be appropriate to show the difference in your translation.

**"They went out from us"**

These people formerly met with the group of believers to whom John is writing.

John is using the expression **from us** in a slightly different sense in these two instances than in the first instance that says, **They went out from us**. In the first instance, it means that these people left the group. In these instances, it means that they were never genuinely part of the group.

**"you have an anointing from the Holy One"**

The word **anointing** refers to the practice, seen often in the Old Testament, of pouring oil on a person to set that person apart to serve God.

**"you have an anointing from the Holy One"**

Here John is using **anointing** to refer to the Holy Spirit. Just as people poured oil on kings and priests to set them apart for service to God, God gives the Holy Spirit to believers to set them apart and equip them to serve God. John says specifically in [3:24](https://ref.ly/1John3:24) and [4:13](https://ref.ly/1John4:13) that God has given the Spirit to believers in this way.

**"the Holy One"**

John is using the adjective **Holy** as a noun in order to indicate a specific person. ULT adds **One** to show this. John is referring specifically to God, and so ULT capitalizes both of these words to show that they are describing a divine person. Your language may allow you to use this adjective as a noun. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “God, the One who is holy”

**"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this double negative by translating it as a positive statement. Since John then repeats the statement in positive form in the next phrase, you could make the connection to that phrase as an affirmation rather than as a contrast.

## 1 John 2:22 (#2) (id: 256572)

**"not the one denying that Jesus is the Christ"**

For emphasis, John is using a double negative in Greek, specifically, a negative verb (**denies**) with a negative particle, “not.” In English, it would come out as “the one who denies that Jesus is not the Christ.” In Greek, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. But in English, the meaning would inaccurately be positive, which is why ULT uses only one negative. It leaves out “not” and says **the one denying that Jesus is the Christ**. However, if your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction in your translation.

**"whenever he appears"**

See the discussion of the term “appear” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. Here the term could have either an active or a passive meaning. In either case, John is not saying that Jesus will only appear to return. He is saying that Jesus will return actually and physically. (1\) If the meaning is active, John is speaking of the act of Jesus physically returning to earth. Alternate translation: “when Jesus returns” (2\) If the meaning is passive, John is speaking of God revealing Jesus to the world as its true king. Alternate translation: “when Jesus is revealed” or “when God brings Jesus”

**"If you know that he is righteous"**

John is using the form of conditional possibility here, but he is stating something that is actually true. In Greek, this was a way of affirming that the part that follows this statement is also true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what John is saying is not certain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement.

## 1 John - Chapter 3 Introduction (id: 700152)

1 John 3 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

1. Genuine children of God do not sin (3:1–10, continuing from 2:28\)
2. Genuine believers help one another sacrificially (3:11–18\)
3. Genuine believers have confidence in prayer (3:19–24\)

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### “children of God”

People are sometimes described as “children of God” because God created them. However, John uses this expression in a different sense in this chapter. He uses it to describe people who have entered into a father\-child relationship with God by putting their faith and trust in Jesus. God indeed created all people, but people can only become children of God in this sense by believing in Jesus. “Children” in this usage does not refer to those who are young, but only to the relationship that people have at any age to their father. (See: Believe)

Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### “the one who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him” (3:24\)

This does not mean that keeping our salvation is conditional on doing certain works. Rather, John is describing the results of keeping the commandments that he describes in [3:32](https://ref.ly/1John3:32). Those commandments are to believe in Jesus and to love one another. John is saying that the person who believes in Jesus and loves others shows that he has a close relationship with God, and that he will continue to have that close relationship because of this obedience. Christians around the world hold different beliefs about whether people who have been saved can lose their salvation. That is not what John is addressing here, and translators should be careful not to let how they understand that issue affect how they translate this passage. (See: Eternity and Save)

Important Textual Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------------

In [3:1](https://ref.ly/1John3:1), the most accurate ancient manuscripts include the words “and we are.” That is the reading that ULT follows. However, some other ancient manuscripts do not include these words, and so some Bibles do not have them. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: Textual Variants)

## 1 John 3:1 (#1) (id: 256618)

**"See"**

John is using the term **See** to focus his reader's attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Consider”

**"children of God"**

Here John expresses the same metaphor as in [2:29](https://ref.ly/1John2:29) in a slightly different way. See whether you decided to indicate the figurative meaning there. If you translate **children** using a literal term, choose a word that can refer to people of any age in relation to their father. Alternate translation: “spiritual children of God”

**"eternal life"**

Since John is speaking of a present reality, by **eternal life** he does not mean living forever in the presence of God after death, which is one thing that this expression can describe. Rather, he means the regenerating power that God gives to believers in this life that helps them to stop sinning and to do what pleases him. Clearly, anyone who is a **murderer** does not have this power at work in him. Alternate translation: “the power that God gives to help us become new people”

Your language may have an equivalent figurative expression that you could use. You could also express the plain meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “closes his heart to him” or “refuses to have compassion on him” or “declines to help him”

**"how does the love of God remain in him"**

See the discussion of the term “remain” in Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John. As in [2:14](https://ref.ly/1John2:14), here the word seems to describe behavior that is recognized to be genuine because it is consistent. Alternate translation: “such a person does not genuinely love others with love that is from God!”

**"how does the love of God remain in him"**

As in [2:5](https://ref.ly/1John2:5), the phrase **the love of God** could mean: (1\) God loving people. Alternate translation: “Is love from God really working in him” (2\) a person loving God. Alternate translation: “is it really possible that he truly loves God” We recommend option (1\) if you must choose. But it is probable that John intends both meanings here, so if your translation can leave the possibilities open, that would be best. Alternate translation: “is he really loving others the way that God loves him”

**"our heart"** \- **"our heart"**

**"God is greater than our heart and knows everything"**

Since John is using the **heart** to mean the thoughts and feelings, the statement that **God is greater than our heart** likely means that God knows and understands more than we do and that God has greater compassion for us than we have for ourselves. In that case, the phrases **is greater than our heart** and **knows everything** would mean similar things.

**"because we keep his commandments and we do the pleasing things before him"**

John is not saying that we **receive** **whatever we ask** in return for obeying God’s commandments and doing what pleases him. Our obedience does not obligate God to give us what we ask for. Our obedience is simply what God has a right to expect from us. Rather, the word **because** reaches back to the statement earlier in this sentence, in the previous verse, that “we have confidence toward God,” that is, we can pray to God confidently. Living in obedience and doing what pleases God gives us confidence to ask for things according to his will. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly by starting a new sentence here that refers back to that statement and explains how John’s statement in this verse relates to it. Alternate translation: “We can pray confidently like this because we obey God’s commandments and do what pleases him, and that assures us that we belong to him”

## 1 John - Chapter 4 Introduction (id: 700153)

1 John 4 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

1. It is false teaching to deny that Jesus became human (4:1–6\)
2. Genuine believers love one another as God has loved them (4:7–21\)

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### “Spirit” and “spirit”

John uses the word “spirit” in different ways in this chapter. Sometimes the word “spirit” clearly refers to a supernatural being. Sometimes the word “spirit” may refer either to the human spirit, to the character of something, or to a supernatural being. Therefore, the expressions “the spirit of the antichrist,” “the spirit of truth,” and “the spirit of error” may refer to the spirit of the humans who promote those things, the attitudes and thinking that are typical of those things, or to spiritual beings who inspire those things. When the word is written with a capital letter, as in the expressions “the Spirit of God” and “his Spirit,” it refers to the Holy Spirit.

Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Loving God

If people love God, they should show it in the way that they live and the way that they treat other people. Doing this may assure us that God has saved us and that we belong to him. But loving others does not save us. Be sure that this is clear in your translation. John says in 4:7 that “everyone who loves is begotten from God and knows God.” As the notes explain, this means that God is the spiritual father of everyone who loves, and everyone who loves is in a close relationship with God. But this love from God is a sign that they belong to God only because of what Jesus did for them on the cross, as John says in 4:10\. They were saved by what Jesus did, not because they themselves loved others. (See: Save)

Important Textual Issues in this Chapter
----------------------------------------

In [4:3](https://ref.ly/1John4:3), the most accurate ancient manuscripts say “acknowledge Jesus.” That is the reading that ULT follows. Some other ancient manuscripts say “acknowledge Jesus Christ having come in the flesh.” (Some of these manuscripts say “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus” instead of “Jesus Christ.”) If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: Textual Variants)

**"this is that of the antichrist"**

Since that the word **that** means “the spirit,” see the discussion of the word “spirit” in the General Notes to this chapter. In this instance, John is referring to either: (1\) the characteristic attitude of something, or (2\) a supernatural being who inspires that attitude.

## 1 John 4:4 (#6) (id: 256777)

**"the one in the world"**

The phrase **in the world** here and in [4:5](https://ref.ly/1John4:5) seems to have a different meaning than in [4:1](https://ref.ly/1John4:1) and [4:3](https://ref.ly/1John4:3). There, it refers to location, so when John says in [4:3](https://ref.ly/1John4:3) that the spirit of the antichrist is “in the world,” it means “on this earth” or “circulating among people.” But here, John seems to be using the term **world** to mean the value system that is opposed to God. In that case, the phrase **the one in the world** would refer to the devil by association with the way that he inspires that system. Alternate translation: “the devil”

**"We"** \- **"to us."** \- **"to us"**

The pronouns **We** and **us** in the first three sentences of this verse are probably exclusive, and so if your language marks that distinction, we recommend using the exclusive form in your translation. John appears to be speaking here of himself and his fellow eyewitnesses of the resurrection as teachers of the truth about Jesus. He has already said that the believers to whom he is writing are from God in [4:4](https://ref.ly/1John4:4).

In this case, **the spirit of truth** would refer to God’s Spirit, and **the spirit of error** would refer to the devil. These would also be what John refers to as “the one in you” and “the one in the world” in [4:4](https://ref.ly/1John4:4). See the UST. (2\) the character of something.

The word **of** here means “some of.” However, God’s Spirit is not something that can be divided. Rather, John is saying that God is sharing his Spirit with us. God’s Spirit can be in many places, and he is fully present in every place. John is saying that through his Spirit, God is fully present in the entire community, and that each believer experiences some of that full presence of God through the presence of the Spirit in his own life. Be sure that it is also clear in your translation that God does not have less of his Spirit now that each of us has some. Alternate translation: “he has sent his Spirit to live in each of us”

**"love has been perfected with us"**

See how you translated the similar expression in [2:5](https://ref.ly/1John2:5).

The clause beginning **so that** could function as: (1\) a result clause. That is, John may be saying that as a result of God’s love achieving its purposes in our lives now, we will be confident on the day of judgment of his forgiveness and acceptance. If you decide that is the case, then your translation should follow the conventions of your language for result clauses. Alternate translation: “with the result that we may have confidence in the day of judgment” (2\) a purpose clause. That is, John may be saying that one reason why God is having his love achieve its purpose in our lives now is that on the day of judgment, he wants us to be confident of his forgiveness and acceptance. If you decide that is the case, then your translation should follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses.

## 1 John - Chapter 5 Introduction (id: 700154)

1 John 5 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

1. It is false teaching to deny that Jesus is the Son of God (5:1–12\)
2. Closing of Letter (5:13–21\)

Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

### “a sin toward death”

It is not entirely clear what John means by this phrase. The word “death” could refer either to physical death or to spiritual death, which is eternal separation from God. See the further discussion in the notes to [5:16](https://ref.ly/1John5:16). (See: death)

### “the whole world lies in the power of the evil one”

The phrase “the evil one” refers to Satan. God has allowed him to rule the world, but, ultimately, God is in control over everything. God keeps his children safe from the evil one. (See: Satan)

Important textual issues in this chapter
----------------------------------------

In [5:7–8](https://ref.ly/1John5:7-1John5:8), all ancient manuscripts say: “For there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one.” That is the reading that ULT follows. Some much later manuscripts say: “For there are three who testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one; and there are three who testify on earth: the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are unto the one.” In this case, translators are advised to translate this as the ULT text does, since there is wide agreement that it follows the accurate reading. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in your region that have the longer reading, you could include it, but you should put it inside square brackets \[ ] and indicate in a footnote that it was most likely not in the original version of 1 John. (See: Textual Variants)

In [5:18](https://ref.ly/1John5:18), the majority of ancient manuscripts say: “the one begotten from God keeps himself.” This means that the believer, whom John has just said is “having been begotten from God” in a spiritual sense, keeps himself away from sin. But many ancient manuscripts say: “the one begotten from God keeps him.” This means that Jesus, who is God's actual, only\-begotten Son, keeps the believer from sin. The ULT follows the reading of the majority of ancient manuscripts, but most English translations follow the other reading. This is probably because the reading with “him” seems to make a more meaningful theological statement than the other reading. Scholars are divided about this, so either choice is acceptable. You may want to follow the reading of the respected translations in your area.

Verses 3 and 4 might be clearer in your language if you reorder and combine them as a verse bridge. To do so, you could begin this sentence with “Since” instead of **For**; you could end it with a comma instead of a period; and you could make it the beginning of the second sentence in the previous verse. It would go before “his commandments are not burdensome.” The word “And” would be left out. The result would be: “For this is the love of God, that we should keep his commandments. Since everyone who has been begotten from God overcomes the world, his commandments are not burdensome. And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith.”

**"This is the one having come by water and blood"**

John is specifying here what it means to believe fully that “Jesus is the Son of God,” as he described in the previous verse. The terms **water** and **blood** are metonyms representing different important ways that the Son of God **came** to us. You may want to clarify these meanings in the text or do so in a footnote. The **blood** represents Jesus’ death on the cross, when he shed his blood as the Savior of the world. The **water** could stand for: (1\) Jesus’ baptism. When John baptized Jesus in the water of the Jordan River, the Son of God began his ministry of reconciling the world to God. See the UST. (2\) Jesus’ birth. There was the breaking of the birth water when the Son of God was born as a man.

**"There is a sin toward death; I am not saying that he should pray about that"**

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what this means. In the context of the whole letter, by **a sin toward death**, John is probably referring to behavior such as the false teachers engaged in and encouraged. As Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John explains, these false teachers claimed that it did not matter what people did in their bodies, and so they would have been committing many serious sins without feeling any conviction that their actions were wrong. This showed that they had abandoned faith in Jesus and had rejected the influence of the Holy Spirit. John implicitly corrects this false teaching again in [5:18](https://ref.ly/1John5:18). Here John is not telling the believers not to pray for some people. Rather, he is explaining that it will not do any good to pray for them since they are determined to live in a way that is contrary to faith in Jesus and the influence of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “There are people (such as the false teachers) who are sinning in a way that shows that they have decided to be separated from God for eternity. Praying for them is not likely to make any difference”

**"the one begotten from God keeps himself"**

Many ancient manuscripts read “the one begotten from God keeps himself.” The ULT follows that reading. In this case, **the one begotten from God** refers to the believer, just as the earlier phrase, **everyone having been begotten from God**, refers to the believer. In this reading, the believer guards himself from sin. Other ancient manuscripts read “the one begotten from God keeps him.” In this case, **the one begotten from God** refers to Jesus, who guards the believer from sin.

**"he"** \- **"is blind, nearsighted"**

In this metaphor, Peter speaks of a person who does not possess these qualities as if the person were **blind** or **nearsighted**. He means this in a spiritual sense, that this person cannot see what is spiritually important.

If it is confusing in your language to describe someone using both of these words in this way, you could use a word like “or” between them or show how they might work together.

If you use a word such as “believers” to translate the metaphor **brothers**, you may need to use both the masculine and the feminine forms of that word in your language.

## 2 Peter 2:17 (#2) (id: 257841)

**"These {men} are waterless springs"**

Peter speaks of the false teachers to describe their uselessness. People expect **springs** to provide water to quench thirst, but **waterless springs** leave thirsty people disappointed. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor by translating this plainly or turn the metaphor into a simile. Alternate translation: “These men are disappointing, like springs without water”

## 2 Peter 2:17 (#3) (id: 257842)

**"mists driven by a storm"**

Peter gives a second figurative description of the uselessness of the false teachers. When people see storm clouds, they expect rain to fall. When the winds from the **storm** blow the clouds away before the rain can fall, the people are disappointed. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor by translating this plainly, or turn the metaphor into a simile. Alternate translation: “they never give what they promise” or “they are disappointing like rain clouds that the storm drives away”

**"A dog returns to its own vomit, and a washed pig to the rolling of mud"**

Peter uses two proverbs to illustrate what the false teachers have done. These proverbs make a figurative comparison: Just as a dog returns to eat its own vomit and a washed pig rolls in the mud again, so these false teachers, who once stopped living a sinful life, have now gone back to living sinfully. Although they knew “the way of righteousness,” they went back to doing the things that defile them morally and spiritually.

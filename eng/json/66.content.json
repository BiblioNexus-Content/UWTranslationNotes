John is speaking in something like Hebrew poetry, which was based on this kind of repetition. It would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if such repetition would not be natural in your language, you could connect the clauses with a word other than <strong>and</strong> in order to show that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is thirsting come, yes, let the one desiring take the water of life freely” or “Let the one who wants to have everlasting life come, yes, let the one who desires everlasting life receive it freely”</p><p>See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26713\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Parallelism</span></p>",

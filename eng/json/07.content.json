    "content": "<h1>Introduction to Judges</h1><h2>Part 1: General Introduction</h2><h3>Outline of Judges</h3><p>A. Introduction: the tribes conquer their territories (1:1–3:6) B. History of the judges of Israel (3:7–16:31) Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar (3:7–31) Deborah and Barak (4:1–5:31) Gideon (6:1–8:35) Abimelek (9:1–57) Tola and Jair (10:1–5) Jephthah (10:6–12:7) Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15) Samson (13:1–16:31) C. Dan becomes a center of idolatry (17:1–18:31) D. Outrage at Gibeah, civil war against Benjamin (19:1–21:25)</p><h3>What is the book of Judges about?</h3><p>The book of Judges tells of events that occurred after the Israelites settled in the land of Canaan. The events in this book happened over a period of about 150 years. The book continues the biblical narrative directly from the book of Joshua. It begins, “After the death of Joshua,” resuming the story at the point it had reached at the end of the book of Joshua.</p><p>This book describes how the Israelites repeatedly sinned against Yahweh during this time. They worshiped false gods and did the same wicked things as the peoples who lived around them. Therefore, God would allow enemies to defeat and oppress the Israelites. Eventually, the Israelites would call to Yahweh for help. Yahweh would then cause someone to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. This person was called a “judge.” The Israelites would live in peace until the judge died. After that judge died, the Israelites would start sinning again. So this pattern of events would repeat.</p><h3>What title should translators give this book?</h3><p>This book has traditionally had the title “Judges” because it gives accounts of some of the main leaders or judges in Israel before there were any kings ruling the people. Unless a translation of the Bible exists in your region that uses a different title, you should probably use the title “Judges” or a similar title such as “The Book about the Leaders in Israel.”</p><h2>Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book</h2><h3>What kind of leaders were the judges?</h3><p>The judges were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. Afterward these leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of these leaders may have served only certain tribes.</p><h3>What kind of society was Israel during the time of the judges?</h3><p>During this time, the twelve tribes of Israel were independent of one another. They were not a unified nation with one ruler. However, they were descendants of the same ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They also shared in the same covenant with Yahweh. So the tribes would often help each other when enemies were threatening them. However, the book of Judges tells of some times when the tribes fought against each other.</p><h2>Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book</h2><h3>“the angel of Yahweh”</h3><p>In many places in the book, the author speaks of a character whom he calls “the angel of Yahweh.” Interpreters are unsure about the exact identity of this character. When he speaks, sometimes the author says “the angel said” and sometimes the author says “Yahweh said.” So he is closely identified with Yahweh in some way, although it is not clear in precisely what way. We recommend that you translate this phrase using the same words that you use in the rest of your translation for “angel” and “Yahweh.” The UST models one way to do this.</p><h3>“arose”</h3><p>In many contexts, the author uses the expression “arose” to mean that a person took action or took on a particular role. It does not mean that he or she stood up from a sitting or lying position. Similarly, characters sometimes tell other characters to “arise,” meaning that they should take action. Notes will help clarify what the expression means in specific contexts. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“behold”</h3><p>The author and characters often use the word “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they are about to say. While the word literally means “look,” the speakers do not want their listeners to look at something, but to pay careful attention. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h3>“in the eyes of”</h3><p>The author and characters often use the term “eyes” by association to mean sight; sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and estimation or judgment. For example, the author says in 2:11 that the Israelites “did evil in the eyes of Yahweh,” meaning that they did what Yahweh considered wrong and had said was wrong. Samson says to his parents in 14:3 about the woman he wants to marry, “she is right in my eyes,” meaning that he thinks she is the right one for him. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>“to the face of”</h3><p>The author and characters often use the word “face” to represent the presence of a person or group, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The expression “to the face of” can have different shades of meaning, depending on the context. The focus may be more on the presence of a person, such as in 20:26, where the author says that the Israelites “sat … to the face of Yahweh.” He means that they were in the presence of Yahweh near his sacred tent. The focus may also be on something being in front of or near a person or thing. When the author says in 3:27 that Ehud was “to the face of” the Israelite soldiers who were with him, he means that Ehud was in front of them, that is, leading their army. Or the focus may be on the relationship between people or groups, as in 11:33, where the author says that “the sons of Ammon were subdued from the face of the sons of Israel.” This means that the Ammonites were subdued in relation to the Israelites, that is, they became subject to them. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><p>In other contexts, the author or a character may use the word “face,” describing part of a person, in order to represent the whole person as being present. For example, in 13:15, when Manoah tells the angel of Yahweh, “we will prepare to your face a kid of goats,” he means that he wants him to remain present so that they can prepare the goat and serve it to him. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26729\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Synecdoche</span>)</p><h3>“into the hand of,” “into your hand”</h3><p>The author and characters often use the word “hand” by association to represent the power and capability of a person. For example, the author says in 11:32 that when Jephthah went to fight the Ammonites, “Yahweh gave them into his hand.” This means that Yahweh gave him the power to defeat them. The word “hand” may also represent possession, as when the author says in 7:8 that Gideon’s soldiers “took provision into their hand.” The word “hand” may also represent agency, as when the author speaks in 3:4 of the commandments that Yahweh gave the Israelites “by the hand of Moses.” In such cases, the author is using the hand, part of a person, to mean the whole person in the act of doing something. Notes will help distinguish the difference between these shades of meaning when that may not be clear from the context. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26729\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Synecdoche</span>)</p><h3>“hear,” “listen”</h3><p>The author and characters often use the terms “hear” and “listen” to mean complying with what someone has said. When humans “hear” or “listen” in this sense, the terms mean “obey,” as when the author says negatively in 2:17 that the disobedient Israelites did not “hear the commandments of Yahweh.” When Yahweh “hears” or “listens” in this sense, it means that he does what someone asks in prayer. For example, when the author says in 13:9 that “God listened to the voice of Manoah,” he means that God answered Manoah’s prayer and sent the angel back to him and his wife. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26687\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information</span>)</p><h3>name of tribe, city, or kingdom representing its people</h3><p>The author and characters often use the name of a tribe, city, or kingdom to represent its people. For example, in 1:12, when Caleb speaks of “whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher,” he is using the name of that city to refer by association to the people who live in it. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><h3>name of a person representing associated or accompanying people</h3><p>For example, in 3:10, when the author says of Othniel that “he went out to war,” he is using Othniel, one person who was involved in this action, to represent everyone who was involved. He means that the army of Israel went out to war with Othniel commanding it. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26729\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Synecdoche</span>)</p><h3>“nose burned against”</h3><p>In several places in the book, the author uses the term “nose” and the expression “burned” to mean anger. For example, in 2:14 he says that “the nose of Yahweh burned against Israel,” meaning that Yahweh became very angry with the Israelites. This is by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose and the way the skin of a person who is angry becomes hotter. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part and disposition of the body. If so, it may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“shall”</h3><p>The ULT represents the Hebrew instructional verb form with the English helping verb “shall.” For example, when Deborah tells Barak in Judges 4:6 “and you shall take with you 10,000 men,” she is instructing him to take 10,000 men with him. Other ways to say this are: “you are to take 10,000 men with you” or “take 10,000 men with you.” Translate this form with the most natural way in your language for giving instructions. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26817\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Irregular Use of Tenses</span>)</p><h3>“sons of”</h3><p>The author and characters often speak of “the sons of” a person to mean the nation or tribe that consists of his descendants. For example, the author speaks in 1:1 of the “sons of Israel” to mean the Israelites and in 1:8 of the “sons of Judah” to mean the people of the tribe of Judah and particularly their army. In this case, “sons” does not mean first-generation offspring but later descendants. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><p>The phrase “sons of” may also refer to people who have a particular characteristic or quality. For example, the author speaks in 18:2 of “sons of valor,” meaning men who were characterized by valor, that is, valiant warriors. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“struck,” “struck to the mouth of the sword”</h3><p>In many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, or king, as if they had only hit them. But he means that they attacked those opponents, and in some contexts the meaning is clearly that they killed them. That is the case in 3:29, for example, where the author says, “And they struck Moab at that time, about 10,000 men … not one escaped.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span>)</p><p>In several contexts the author uses a longer form of this expression and says “they struck them (or it) to the mouth of the sword.” This means that they completely destroyed a city, killing everyone who lived there. For example, speaking in 1:25 of what the tribes descended from Joseph did to Bethel, the author says that “they struck the city with the mouth of the sword.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“went up,” “went down”</h3><p>In Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. For example, in 1:3 the soldiers of Judah ask the soldiers of Simeon to “go up” with them into their allotment because the Israelites were in the valley of the Jordan River and the Judeans’ allotment was in the hills above the valley. In 3:27, the author says that the fighting men of Ephraim “went down” with Ehud because they were going from the hill country of Ephraim down into the Jordan River valley. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate instances such as these simply as “go” or “went.”</p>",

This prevented a captured enemy from running away or from ever using a weapon again. However, as the context shows, it was also a way of humiliating a captured king. When the Israelites did this to Adoni-Bezek, he acknowledged that he was getting what he deserved for having done this to others.</p><h3>Complete destruction of a city and its people</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:17\">1:17</a>, the armies of Judah and Simeon completely destroy a Canaanite city and kill all of its people. They call the place “Hormah,” which means “destruction.” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:4\">Deuteronomy 7:1–4</a> describes how, when Yahweh was preparing the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commanded them to destroy completely the Canaanite people who lived there. They were not to make any treaties with them or to intermarry with them. This was to prevent the Israelites from joining them in worshiping their false gods, which would have led them to develop a culture and society very different from the kind that Yahweh wanted. The book of Joshua describes how the Israelites completely destroyed the major Canaanite cities and their people. In this chapter, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:17\">1:17</a> describes a further instance of that. However, the Israelites left many of the Canaanite people in the land, and they did intermarry with them and worship their gods. This led the Israelites into many evil practices that made Yahweh very angry with them.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Names of people groups, cities, and Israelite tribes meaning their people or armies</h3><p>In this chapter, the author and characters frequently use the names of people groups or cities by association to mean the people or armies of those groups or cities. For example, when the author says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:1\">1:1</a> that the Israelites “fought against Jerusalem,” he means that they fought against the people who lived in that city. The author and characters sometimes also speak of the Israelite tribes as if they were individual people who could talk to one another, go places together, and so forth. For example, the author says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:1\">1:1</a>, “Then Judah said to Simeon, his brother, ‘Go up with me into my allotment.’” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. For example, instead of saying “Judah,” you could say “the people of the tribe of Judah.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26707\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metonymy</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26716\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Personification</span>)</p><h3>Generic nouns</h3><p>In this chapter, the author and characters use expressions such as “the Canaanite,” “the Perizzite,” “the Amorite,” and so forth. They are not referring to specific individuals. Rather, they mean in general the people of the nation mentioned. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms, for example, “the Canaanites.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26691\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Generic Noun Phrases</span>)</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 2 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><ul><li><p>Verses 1–5: The angel of Yahweh appears to the Israelites at Bokim</p></li><li><p>Verses 6–10: Review: the Israelites worshiped and obeyed Yahweh during the lifetimes of Joshua and the elders</p></li><li><p>Verses 11–23: The Israelites disobeyed Yahweh and worshiped other gods afterward, so Yahweh let other nations conquer them</p></li></ul><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Joshua reappears in the story after it tells how he died</h3><p>In Judges 2:6–9, the author repeats Joshua 24:28–31 to remind readers how the people of Israel served Yahweh faithfully when they first arrived in the land of Canaan. This is background information. After these verses, the main story of the book of Judges begins. It is about how the Israelites then worshiped other gods, but Yahweh repeatedly brought them back to himself and delivered them from their enemies when they repented. It may seem strange for the book to speak of Joshua doing something, since it begins “after the death of Joshua.” So you can translate this in a way that shows that the author is providing background information by describing something that happened in the past. See the note at 2:6 for a specific suggestion.</p><h3>“Cut a covenant”</h3><p>The phrase “cut a covenant” occurs in this chapter. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” reflects the cultural background. It is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Metaphor</h3><p>In this chapter, the author uses the word “fathers” several times to mean “ancestors.” He is not speaking of the immediate male parents of the Israelites, but of the generations who lived before them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h3>Symbolic action</h3><p>In this chapter, the author speaks of the Israelites bowing down to idols that represented foreign gods. This was a symbolic action that constituted a public act of worship, so it represented a definitive expression of allegiance to those gods. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. When the book says that the Israelites bowed down to foreign gods, you could say, for example, that they “worshiped them by bowing down to them.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"UW_TXManual_figs-symaction\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">figs-symaction</span>)</p>",

Because of this, Yahweh allowed the nations of Aram and Moab to rule over them. In the period of Judges, when Israel sinned, they were often placed under the rule of a foreign power. However, when the people repented, Yahweh sent judges to deliver them. This chapter describes how Yahweh sent Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar to rescue Israel from foreign control. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25728\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">False God</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26240\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Sin</span>)</p><h3>The carved images at Gilgal</h3><p>Biblical scholars are not entirely sure what the “carved images” mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:19\">3:19</a> were. They could have been some kind of boundary marker. Some interpreters associate them with the twelve large stones that Joshua set up at Gilgal in Joshua <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:20\">4:20</a>. They seem to have been a recognizable landmark of some kind. Once Ehud and the porters reached them, Ehud knew that the porters were back in Israelite territory and could find their way safely back home from there without him. In your translation, you might refer to these as “carved stones” or, as in the UST, “boundary stones.”</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 4 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><h3>The place of this story in the book</h3><p>To this point, after giving an introduction to the stories of the judges (1:1–3:6), the author has briefly described the work of three judges: Othniel (3:7–11), Ehud (3:12–30), and Shamgar (3:31). In this chapter, he describes at more length the work of another judge, Deborah, and the man she called and helped to lead an Israelite army, Barak.</p><h3>The ending of the story</h3><p>In verses 23 and 24, the author ends the story with a summary of what happened. He presents the information in a special form called a chiasm, in which the first and last parts match and the middle parts match. These parts match: “So on that day God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan” and “until that they destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan.” These parts also match: “to the face of the sons of Israel” and “For going, the hand of the sons of Israel went and {became} severe against Jabin, the king of Canaan.” You may be able to show this in your translation by using some special formatting. For example: So on that day God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan to the face of the sons of Israel For going, the hand of the sons of Israel went and {became} severe against Jabin, the king of Canaan until that they destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>How had Yahweh already begun to fight Sisera before the Israelites attacked?</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:14\">4:14</a>, Deborah tells Barak that it is time to attack Sisera’s forces because Yahweh has already begun to fight against them. It is not clear from this chapter entirely what this means. But readers learn in the next chapter that there was a great storm on the day of this battle. Deborah says in her song (in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:4\">5:4</a>) that when Yahweh marched out, “dark clouds dripped down water” and “the earth shook” (perhaps a reference to thunder). She speaks in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:21\">5:21</a> of the Kishon River flooding. The historian Josephus writes of this battle that “as soon as the armies were engaged, there arose a prodigious tempest of hail and rain, which drove in the faces of the Canaanites, and occasioned a total rout of them.” With the rain, hail, and flooding, Sisera’s forces were not able to make use of their chariots. Barak was able to lead his troops down from the relative safety of Mount Tabor onto the plain and destroy Sisera’s army and its chariots.</p><h3>“Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman”</h3><p>When Deborah tells Barak to raise an army to oppose Sisera, he replies, “If you will go with me, then I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:8\">4:8</a>). Deborah agrees to go with him, but she also tells him that the credit and honor for killing Sisera will not go to him but to a woman. Interpreters have many different ideas about what this means. One possibility is that Barak was insisting on having visible, tangible assurance of God’s presence and help in the person of Deborah, who was a prophetess. Deborah graciously agreed to accompany Barak and provide this assurance, but at the same time she indicated to him that God’s power was so great that Barak should not have put this condition on his obedience. God would use a woman, who in this culture would not have been a warrior, to kill Sisera. At this time, great honor came from killing an enemy commander, and this honor would not go to Barak but to this woman and ultimately to God, who would arrange the circumstances for it. However, it is not necessary to resolve the meaning of this exchange in order to translate this passage. You can report the conversation between Deborah and Barak naturally in your translation without adding any interpretation.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 5 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>In this chapter, the author presents a song that Deborah and Barak sang to celebrate the victory that Yahweh enabled them to win over Sisera.</p><p>Some translations prefer to set apart quotations, prayers, and songs with special formatting. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of chapter 5, which is a song, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>How were the Israelites able to fight against Sisera if they had no weapons?</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:8\">5:8</a>, this song describes how Jabin’s occupying soldiers took away the weapons that the Israelites had. So how were the Israelites able to fight a battle against Sisera’s forces? As a note to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:2\">4:2</a> explains, the name Harosheth Haggoyim may describe a place where Jabin forced captive peoples to cut wood for him. It has been suggested that the conscripted Israelites who joined Barak’s army took their axes and hatchets with them and used them as weapons.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Hebrew poetry</h3><p>Except for a brief introduction and conclusion, this chapter is poetry that consists of pairs of phrases that repeat the same meaning. The second phrase advances the idea of the first by affirming, contrasting, or supplementing it in different words. (Sometimes there is a third line with similar meaning.) Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both (or all three) phrases in your translation. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than <strong>and</strong> in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the idea of the first one, not saying something different. For example, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:2\">5:2</a> you might say, “For the loosening of long hair in Israel, yes, for the volunteering of the people.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26713\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Parallelism</span>)</p><h3>Deborah and Barak singing this song together</h3><p>While the author says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:1\">5:1</a> that both “Deborah and Barak” sang this song, the first-person verbs and pronouns in it are singular. It was common for the Israelites to sing in responsive parts, so it may be that Deborah and Barak each sang parts of this song individually, responding to one another. For example, it seems probable that in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:12\">5:12</a> Barak sang “awake, Deborah” and Deborah responded “Arise, Barak.”</p><p>Hebrew does not mark first-person pronouns or verbs for gender, so it is not clear in many cases which of them sang which parts, although in some cases the text does give us a fair idea. For the sake of languages that do mark first-person singular pronouns or verbs for gender, here are some suggestions as to who might be singing when the song says “I” or “my.” This is, however, largely a matter of interpretation, so use your own best judgment in your translation. Since Deborah and Barak are, in a sense, speaking for each other, another alternative would be to use plural first-person pronouns. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26838\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Pronouns — When to Use Them</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26732\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Singular Pronouns that refer to Groups</span>)</p><ul><li><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:3\">5:3</a>, you could consider using masculine forms for “I … {even} I, let me sing” and feminine forms for “I will make music.” The verb translated as “make music” refers to singing with an instrumental accompaniment. Deborah was a prophetess, and the Old Testament prophets appear to have sung at least some of their prophecies to instrumental accompaniment. (See, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek33:32\">Ezekiel 33:32</a>.) So it is perhaps more likely that Deborah sang “I will make music” and Barak sang “let me sing.”</p></li><li><p>Deborah is speaking of herself as “I” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:7\">5:7</a>, so it would be appropriate to use feminine forms there.</p></li><li><p>It has been suggested that in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:9\">5:9</a>, it would be more appropriate for Deborah to thank the leaders, who would have included Barak, and for Barak to thank those who volunteered in response to his summons. So you may wish to mark “My” as feminine.</p></li><li><p>Barak is probably referring to himself as “me” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:13\">5:13</a>, since he was the one who led the Israelite army “against the warriors” of Sisera.</p></li><li><p>Barak seems to be speaking in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:15\">5:15</a>, “my commanders in Issachar were with Deborah,” because otherwise Deborah would be speaking of herself in the third person, which she does not seem to do in this song.</p></li><li><p>It has been suggested that in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:21\">5:21</a>, Barak may have described the Kishon River flooding, since he saw this first-hand in the battle, and then said, “March on, my soul, in strength,” recalling how the Israelite soldiers pursued the attack against Sisera vigorously when they saw how the flooding had put them and their chariots at a disadvantage.</p></li></ul><h3>A different setting for part of the song</h3><p>There is an apparent change of setting in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:10-Judg5:11\">5:10–11</a>, from the original performance of the song at a victory celebration to its repeated recitation at places where travelers stopped along the road for water. In this part of the song, Deborah and Barak are not addressing people who are not present as if they could hear them. That is a poetic device that writers and speakers in the Bible sometimes use, but it does not occur here. Rather, verses 10 and 11 of the song reflect its later use at “watering places” to commemorate the victory over Sisera and Jabin. So translate verse 10 as a direct address to people who are present.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 7 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and formatting</h2><p>The account of Gideon, which began in chapter 6, continues in this chapter.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Why does the barley loaf represent Gideon?</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:13\">7:13</a>, a Midianite soldier tells his friend that the loaf of barley bread in the dream the friend has just recounted must represent Gideon. He says this because barley was a grain that only poorer people ate, and as <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:6\">6:6</a> states, the Midianites had reduced the Israelites to poverty. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:11\">6:11</a>, Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites; they may have taken the wheat from Israel but left the barley because they did not want to eat it. Beyond this, the “sons of the east” were nomadic herders, so they would have associated grain with a farming culture such as the Israelites had. For these reasons, the soldier recognizes that the loaf of barley bread represents the Israelite army under the command of Gideon. A note to verse 13 suggests a way to indicate this in your translation.</p><h3>Mount Gilead</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:3\">7:3</a>, Yahweh tells Gideon to announce to his troops that anyone who is afraid can depart from “Mount Gilead.” In this context, that name cannot refer, as it usually does, to the mountainous region east of the Jordan River. The Valley of Jezreel, where the two armies had gathered for battle, was west of the Jordan River. Since Gilead was the ancestor of a major part of the tribe of Manasseh, including the Abiezrites, and since that tribe had territory on both sides of the Jordan, it is possible that the people of Manasseh had named a mountain after Gilead on the west side of the river, near where Gideon’s army had assembled. But such a mountain is not known from any other source. Some commentators have suggested instead that “Mount Gilead” might have been a name that the soldiers of Manasseh gave to their army, to describe both its strength and its lineage. However, there is no evidence elsewhere for that either. But since this is ultimately a matter of interpretation rather than of translation, is probably best to translate the expression as “Mount Gilead” and allow preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain the possible meanings.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“into their hand”/“into your hand” (plural “you”)</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, the author or characters use the expressions “into their hand” and “into your hand” (with a plural “you”). Since this expression refers to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of <strong>hand</strong>.

    "content": "<h1>Judges 8 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>The account of Gideon concludes in this chapter.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>The tower in Penuel</h3><p>Ancient cities and towns often built protective towers. Their citizens could go inside them for safety, and from the top of them their soldiers had an advantage in fighting attacking armies. The leaders of Penuel probably thought that they were safe from the Midianites because they had such a tower. Gideon told them that he was going to tear down their tower to show that they should have taken his side in the fight against the Midianites.</p><h3>Why did Gideon kill the men of Penuel?</h3><p>It seems difficult to understand why, when Gideon returned to Penuel (8:17), he “killed the men of the city.” He had only said he would tear down their tower, just as he had only told the leaders of Succoth that he would whip them with thorny branches, and that was all he did to them. Here is one possible explanation. In 8:16, the author uses the phrase “the men of Succoth” to mean the same thing as “the elders of the city.” So the phrase “the men of the city” in 8:17 may refer to the town leaders of Penuel. The author may be saying that when Gideon tore down the tower, this killed the town leaders. That may have happened because those leaders took refuge in the tower, thinking they would be safe from Gideon there because he would not be able to tear down the tower or that he would not tear it down if they were in it. A note to 8:17 suggests an alternate translation that suggests this meaning.</p><h3>Why did Gideon tell his son Jether to kill the Midianite kings?</h3><p>In 8:20, Gideon tells his son Jether, who was still a young man, to kill the Midianite kings Zeba and Zalmunna. This was in some way a symbolic action, but interpreters are not entirely sure of what kind. Here are some possibilities: (1) Gideon could have been intending to give an honor to his son. Gideon had already appeased the Ephraimites by telling them what an honor it had been for them to kill Oreb and Zeeb (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:3\">8:3</a>), and he may have wanted his firstborn son to have a similar honor. If that is the significance of this action, in your translation you might have Gideon say to Jether, “I will give you the honor of killing these kings.” (2) Gideon could have been intending to dishonor Zeba and Zalmunna. They had apparently killed Gideon’s brothers by murder rather than in battle, and so Gideon did not consider them worthy of being killed by a person of status, such as himself. (In this culture, it was customary for someone to be executed by a person of equal status; see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:29\">1 Kings 2:29</a>.) If that is the significance, you might have Gideon say to Jether, “I am going to have you, a youth, kill them.” (3) Gideon could have wanted to emphasize to Jether that he needed to be prepared to fight against the oppressors of Yahweh’s people, just as he had. In that case, you might have Gideon say, “Kill these enemy kings, as you must be prepared to fight to free Yahweh’s people from oppression.”</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 9 General Notes</h1><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>“upon one stone”</h3><p>The author says in 9:5 that Abimelek and the men he hired brought all of his half-brothers, the other sons of Gideon, to “one stone” and killed them there. There seems to have been some symbolic significance to this action. The stone might have been a place of formal execution. Abimelek could have killed his half-brothers there to indicate that he had taken authority as king and so no threats to his rule should be allowed to exist. The stone might also have been a religious altar of some kind. Some interpreters believe that Abimelek and the leaders of Shechem were executing Gideon’s sons on a stone altar to avenge his desecration of Baal’s altar. This would explain why money from the temple of Baal-Berith paid for the action. However, since the exact purpose is unclear, it would be best to say no more about this in your translation than the original text does.</p><h3>Jotham’s curse</h3><p>In 9:20, Jotham, the one son of Gideon who survived Abimelek’s massacre, says, “may fire go forth from Abimelek and may it consume the lords of Shechem and Beth Millo, and may fire go forth from the lords of Shechem and from Beth Millo and may it consume Abimelek.” This was a curse. Jotham was expressing a desire for bad things to happen to the people who had murdered the sons of the man who had delivered them from the Midianites. What Jotham was ultimately wishing for was God’s justice. He wanted people who had done such bad things to have bad things happen to them. His curse was fulfilled in a literal way when Abimelek burned the lords of Shechem to death in 9:49. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25632\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Curse</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Jotham’s parable about the trees</h3><p>In 9:8–15, Gideon’s surviving son, Jotham, tells the lords of Shechem a parable. A parable is a short story that teaches something that is true. It delivers its lesson in a way that is easy to understand and hard to forget. In many cases, the events in a parable could happen, though they did not actually happen. But in this case, they could not have happened, since this parable is about trees talking to each other about appointing a king. However, either way, the events of a parable are told only to teach the lesson that the listeners are meant to learn. See the first note to 9:8 for suggestions about how to introduce and begin this parable in your translation.</p><h3>Did God send an “evil spirit” to Shechem?</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:23\">9:23</a>, the author says that God sent a “bad spirit” that made the lords of Shechem hostile toward Abimelek. The word that the ULT translates as “bad” can also mean “evil,” depending on the context. Some versions of the Bible in various languages translate it as “evil” here. Translators may have encountered that reading. However, the context does not seem to support it. The teaching of the Bible as a whole suggests that God would not use something evil to accomplish his purposes. Also, evil spirits have rebelled against God, and so they have forfeited the right to be part of what he is doing. Moreover, the word “spirit” does not necessarily refer to a spiritual being here. It could refer instead to the attitude that Abimelek and the lords of Shechem had toward one another. This would be the same meaning as in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:3\">8:3</a>, “their spirit abated toward him,” which means, “they no longer had a hostile attitude toward him.” So it seems appropriate to understand the author to be saying in 9:23 that God caused hostility between Abimelek and the lords of Shechem.</p><h3>Why did Gaal go and stand in the gate of Shechem?</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:35\">9:35</a>, the author says that “Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city” of Shechem. He does not say explicitly why Gaal did this. Gaal does not seem to have known that Abimelek and his troops were nearby, since Zebul was able to convince him otherwise at first (as the next verse describes). Gaal, given his boast against Abimelek at the temple banquet, may have wanted to watch and see whether there was any danger. He may have expected to be able to see approaching troops while they were still far away and arrange a defense before they arrived. But since the author does not say explicitly why Gaal went out to the city gate, it would probably be best not to suggest any reason for this in your translation.</p><h3>Why did the people of Shechem go out of their city the day after Abimelek defeated Gaal?</h3><p>In 9:42, the author says that the people of Shechem went out of their city the day after Abimelek defeated Gaal, but he does not say why. In this verse, “went out” does not seem to describe a military operation, as it does in 9:39 in the case of Gaal. Instead, the people of Shechem seem to have thought mistakenly that they could let Gaal try to defeat Abimelek and become their ruler and that, if he failed, they could still serve Abimelek. So they were probably just going out to work in their fields. You may find it appropriate to use a different expression in your translation for “went out” in 9:42 than you do for that phrase in 9:39.</p>",

Since the lords of Shechem had given Abimelek money from the temple of Baal-Berith to establish himself as king, Baal-Berith was Abimelek’s patron god.

While female slaves sometimes did become the concubines of their masters, not every concubine was a female slave. Abimelek’s mother seems to have come from a family of standing in Shechem; Gideon may have married her as a concubine rather than as a full wife because she was a foreigner, from the surviving Canaanite population of Shechem. So Jotham is disparaging her by calling her a <strong>female slave</strong>. His main point seems to be that Abimelek has no rights of inheritance and thus no claim to become king. (Unfortunately Gideon suggested otherwise when he named this son Abimelek, meaning “my father is king.”) You could bring out this emphasis in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

He uses the name of a country or city to speak of the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab. But he describes the inhabitants of a country or cities when he speaks of the gods of “the sons of Ammon” and “the Philistines.” This is because, as the next verse indicates, it was the Ammonites and the Philistines who next conquered and oppressed the Israelites and whom the next two judges opposed. Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, as chapters 11 and 12 describe, and Samson fought against the Philistines, as chapters 13–16 describe. If possible, use slightly different possessive forms in your own translation to reflect this distinction. The UST models one way to do this.</p><p>Order of information</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:7\">10:7</a>, the author presents new information in a particular order for a specific reason. In the book, he relates the oppression by the Ammonites and the deliverance by Jephthah in chapters 10–12, before he describes the oppression by the Philistines and the resistance of Samson in chapters 13–16. But in this verse he is creating a special arrangement between the phrase “into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the sons of Ammon” and those next sections of the book. This arrangement is known as a chiasm. In it, the first and last parts match and the middle parts match. In other words, the author is creating this arrangement: Philistines—Ammonites (this phrase); Ammonites—Philistines (the next sections of the book). However, if it would better help your readers to recognize how this phrase introduces the following accounts of Jephthah and Samson, you could name these people groups in the order in which they feature in the narrative. You might say, in other words, “into the hand of the sons of Ammon and into the hand of the Philistines”</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 11 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>The account of Jephthah continues in this chapter.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Why did Jephthah sacrifice his daughter?</h3><p>The story of Jephthah defeating the Ammonites has a tragic ending. He vows that if Yahweh will give him victory, upon his return, he will sacrifice the first person who comes out of his house as a burnt offering. This person turns out to be his daughter, his only child. But he fulfills his vow anyway and sacrifices her. Part of the explanation for this is that Jephthah’s half-brothers drove him away from their home in Israel so that he had to live in Syria. The Syrians practiced human sacrifice, and Jephthah apparently came to regard it as a way of influencing a deity. The rest of the explanation is that Jephthah did not know the provisions of the law of Moses. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev27:1-Lev27:8\">Leviticus 27:1–8</a>, Yahweh tells Moses that if someone dedicates a person, he must redeem that person by paying a certain amount of silver shekels. That is what Jephthah was supposed to do. It was all right for him to devote a family member to Yahweh as long as he then redeemed that person. The author of Judges is using this story to show what happens when, as he says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:6\">17:6</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg21:25\">21:25</a>, everyone does what is right in his own eyes, rather than what Yahweh has commanded. This supports the overall argument of the book that Israel should have a good king who makes sure that the Israelites follow the law of Moses.</p>",

They were to make a Nazarite vow, a special type of vow dedicating Samson to Yahweh. Part of this vow prohibited cutting the person’s hair. The person also could not drink beer or wine or even eat grapes. Samson’s mother was to observe those prohibitions even while she was pregnant, since anything she ate or drank would also nourish the baby in her womb.

This is why Samson’s parents did not want him to marry a Philistine woman.</p><h3>How could Samson do such great feats of strength?</h3><p>The author says of Samson in 14:6 and 14:19 that “the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him.” This means that Yahweh gave Samson extraordinary strength. Samson’s power was the power of Yahweh himself. He was an agent of Yahweh’s judgment against the Philistines.</p>",

In Numbers 6:5, the law of Moses forbade Nazirites to cut their hair. Samson kept his hair long because he was a Nazirite. The law of Moses did not specify that Nazirites needed to wear their hair in seven locks or braids. But Samson was doing that as a symbolic action that represented his dedication to God. The number seven symbolized completeness, so the seven braids could have represented the perfection of God or the complete devotion that the Nazirite vow entailed. However, it would not be appropriate to explain the significance of this action in your translation by having Samson say something such as “the seven braids that show I am dedicated to God.” That is the secret that Samson is trying to keep from Delilah. Though he eventually divulges it, he does not do so when he first mentions the seven braids of his hair. But you might put something about this in a footnote if that would be helpful for your readers.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 17 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter begins the final section of the book of Judges. In this section, the author describes the atrocities and chaos that characterized the nation in the absence of a godly leader. Many of the judges had been godly leaders who made sure that the people of Israel obeyed Yahweh. But since they were all individuals whom God raised up at specific times, there was not a continuity of godly leadership. As the author says earlier in the book, “when Yahweh raised up for them judges, then Yahweh was with the judge and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all of the days of the judge. … But it happened, at the death of the judge, they turned and acted corruptly more than their fathers, to walk after other gods, to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not drop {any} of their deeds or {any} of their stubborn ways” (2:18–19). So in this section, the author is showing how important and helpful it would have been to have a continuity of godly leadership such as a line of good kings would provide. A godly leader would guide the people in the true worship of Yahweh and ensure justice and righteousness. This was fulfilled partially by David, and it has now been fulfilled definitively by God’s Messianic king, Jesus.</p><p>In this chapter and the next one, the author describes how idolatry took root in Israel, in the additional territory that the tribe of Dan conquered for itself.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Idols and figures</h3><p>The law of Moses forbade the Israelites to make any idols. While the instructions Yahweh gave Moses for the tabernacle included making metal figures, the Israelites were not to make any figures that represented gods that they would worship. This practice was common in Canaan, and it shows the influence the Israelites allowed these people to have on them. Micah’s mother should not have had an image made out of silver, and Micah should not have set it up as an idol and gotten a priest to serve at the shrine where he put it. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"UnfoldingWord_TranslatorWords_idol\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">idol</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“an idol and a cast image”</h3><p>The author speaks of what Micah’s mother had a refiner make from her silver as “an idol and a cast image.” Some interpreters understand this to be two things, while other interpreters understand it to be one thing. Like many languages, Hebrew sometimes expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” If that is what the author is doing here, he means that this was a cast image that served as an idol. In 18:20, he speaks simply of “the idol” apparently to mean the same thing as “an idol and a molded image” in 18:14. That suggests that the phrase “an idol and a cast image” does mean a cast image that served as an idol or an idol that was made by casting an image. In your translation, you may wish to use a phrase such as “a molded idol” as the UST does.

He notes that they were Sidonians, not Canaanites such as Yahweh had told the Israelites to drive out, and that they were living peacefully, not posing any threat. The Israelites had been given exceptional instructions to kill all of the Canaanites. Most interpreters believe that this was so that the Canaanites would not influence the Israelites to follow their practices, which were very wicked and destructive. But Yahweh did not tell the Israelites to kill all the people from other groups. So readers are meant to understand implicitly that the soldiers from Dan committed an atrocity against the people of Laish. The author is presenting this as evidence that if Israel had a godly king, he would maintain order and justice throughout the land, protect vulnerable people, and lead Israel away from idolatry and toward proper worship and obedience of Yahweh.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“an idol and a cast image”</h3><p>See the discussion of this phrase, which occurs several times in this chapter, in the General Notes to Chapter 17.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 19 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and formatting</h2><p>In this chapter, the author begins to tell a story that provides further evidence of the benefits of Israel having a godly king. He describes an outrageous crime that Israelite men in the city of Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin committed against a helpless person.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Why did the Levite push his concubine out to the mob?</h3><p>This chapter describes how a mob of men in the city of Gibeah wanted to rape a Levite man who was staying in the city overnight. While the men were going to use sex as a weapon, what they intended was ultimately a crime of power and violence. The Levite believed they were going to kill him (see 20:5). So to save his own life, he pushed his concubine out to the mob, and they raped and killed her. The author describes this crime as further evidence that Israel needed a godly king who would maintain order and justice and protect vulnerable people. The author is not presenting what the Levite did, or what his host offered to do (surrendering his daughter and the Levite’s concubine to the mob), as exemplary. The Bible is not saying through this story that a sexual crime against a woman is not as bad as a sexual crime against a man. It is not saying that men may or should sacrifice family members in order to save their own lives. The example that the Bible presents for us to imitate is that of Jesus, who sacrificed himself in order to save others.</p><h3>Why did the Levite cut up the dead body of his concubine?</h3><p>The author describes in 19:29 how the Levite brought the body of his murdered concubine home and cut it into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the land of Israel. He probably had messengers carry pieces through the territory of each of the twelve tribes and explain what had happened. Cutting the woman’s body into twelve pieces was a symbolic action that called for collective vengeance by all twelve tribes of Israel. The implicit message was that this outrageous crime had defiled the entire land and that the Israelites corporately had a responsibility to cleanse the land by executing justice on the perpetrators. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation. You might say, for example, “and he cut her body into twelve pieces, one to send to each tribe of Israel to call for collective vengeance.”</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 20 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>In this chapter, the author continues the story he began in Chapter 19 which provides evidence of the benefits of Israel having a godly king in the future. He tells how the Benjaminites refused to surrender the men who had committed the outrageous crime and how the Israelites fought a very destructive war against them to purge Israel from the guilt and defilement of this crime.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Why does the Levite say that the “lords of Gibeah” encircled the house?</h3><p>As the Levite is giving an account of the crime to the Israelite assembly, he says that “the lords of Gibeah arose against me, and they encircled the house at night against me” (20:5). He probably does not mean that the legal rulers of the city of Gibeah did this, even though he is using the same term that the author uses for such rulers several times in Chapter 9 when he speaks of the “lords of Shechem.” (The phrase “the lords of the Philistines,” which occurs several times in Chapter 16, uses a different term for “lords,” but it has the same meaning.) Rather, the Levite probably means that the wicked men who surrounded the house where he was staying could do whatever they wanted in the city and no one could stop them. It was as if they actually were the “lords” of the city. The UST models one way to convey this meaning.</p><h3>Why does the Levite say that the men of Gibeah intended to “kill” him?</h3><p>The wicked men in Gibeah shout in 19:22 to those inside the house that they want to “know” the Levite, that is, to assault him sexually. When the Levite gives an account of their crime in 20:5, he says that they intended to kill him. He probably says this because he recognizes that while the men were going to use sex as a weapon, they intended to commit a crime of power and violence that would likely have involved killing him in the end. That is what they did to his concubine. The UST models one way to convey this meaning.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“drawing a sword”</h3><p>Several times in this chapter, the author describes men as “drawing a sword.” He is using one thing that a skilled fighter would learn to do to represent all the things that such a fighter would do. The meaning is that such men were experienced soldiers. Use a word or phrase in your translation that would convey that meaning. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26729\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Synecdoche</span>)</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Judges 21 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>In this chapter, the author concludes the story he began in Chapter 19 by showing the benefits of Israel having a godly king. He tells how the Israelites realized that they had gone too far in destroying the Benjaminites and how they resorted to further violence and deceit in order to provide wives for the surviving Benjaminites so that they could continue their family lines. The implied information in 21:5 is that the Israelites thought that if they killed all the people of that city except its young women, they could give them as wives to the surviving men from the tribe of Benjamin.</p><h2>Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Sin and immorality</h3><p>At the end of Judges, there is much sin and immorality. The people are doing wrong and are trying to fix their wrongs by doing more evil things. The period of the Judges is typified by this final account and summarized by the author’s closing statement, “A man did the right in his eyes” (ULT), which means that “everyone did what they thought they should do” (UST). The book of Judges ends this way in order to lead into the following part of the biblical narrative, which describes how God chose David to be a godly king of the Israelite people.

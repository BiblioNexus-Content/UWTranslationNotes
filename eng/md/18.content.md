### What is the book of Job about?

The book of Job is about a man named Job who experienced disaster even though he was faithful to Yahweh. Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh has allowed him to experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.

### What title should translators give to this book?

The book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or simply “Job.” Or they may choose a different title such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”

### Who wrote the book of Job?

We do not know who wrote the book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### Does sin cause suffering?

When a person sins against Yahweh, that can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors had sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: Sin)

### Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?

Job 2:11 describes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. However, they did not succeed in comforting Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” What they said did not help Job, because they did not understand the full truth about God. However, they did care about Job, and they did want to help him. In those ways, they did what friends would do, and in that sense the word “friends” is appropriate.

### When did the events in the book of Job take place?

We do not know when the events in the book of Job took place. The story is set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to verses in the books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which were written many centuries after Abraham and Isaac lived. It is possible that the book of Job was written at a later time to describe the events of an earlier time.

### The “sea monster”

Ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean. They referred to it as the “sea monster.” People in Job's culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos, and they associated this sea monster with that chaos. There are references to this creature in the book of Job under the names Leviathan in [3:8](https://ref.ly/Job3:8), the “sea monster” in [7:12](https://ref.ly/Job7:12), Rahab in [9:13](https://ref.ly/Job9:13) and [26:12](https://ref.ly/Job26:12), and the “fleeing serpent” in [26:13](https://ref.ly/Job26:13). The description of Leviathan in chapter 41 also seems to be a description of this same creature. Notes at these various places suggest how you might represent these references in your translation.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### Is the book of Job difficult to translate?

The book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases. That makes parts of it hard to understand and translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may also decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.

### What style of writing is in the book of Job?

The author begins and ends the book of Job by relating what happened to Job in narrative form. In the rest of the book, the characters speak in poetry. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom. The relationship of human conduct to human prosperity and suffering is an important theme in wisdom literature.

### Hebrew poetry: parallelism

Hebrew poetry was based on repetition of meaning rather than on repetition of sound like poetry in some other languages. A speaker would typically say one phrase and then say another phrase (or two) that meant a similar thing, an opposite thing, or something supplementary. The subsequent phrase or phrases would advance the meaning of the first phrase in one of these ways. In many cases it would be good to show this to your readers by including all the phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that would show how the later phrase or phrases are advancing the meaning of the first one. Throughout the book, notes will model ways of doing this in various cases, although not in most cases. It is hoped that these illustrations will give translators an idea of what they could do in any given instance.

### Hebrew poetry: chiasm

Hebrew poetry often uses a form known as “chiasm.” It will make a statement consisting of two elements. It will then make a parallel, contrasting, or supplemental statement consisting of those same two elements, but in reverse order. For example, Job says in 3:5:

May it not rejoice among the days of the year; into the number of the months may it not come.

You may wish to show this form in your translation by following the Hebrew word order, even if that would not ordinarily be the order you would follow in your language. For 3:5, English might ordinarily say:

May it not rejoice among the days of the year; may it not come into the number of the months.

But the ULT follows the Hebrew word order in order to give an idea of this characteristic form of Hebrew poetry.

### “answered and said”

The author uses the phrase “answered and said” many times in the book of Job. This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and”. The word “answered” tells for what purpose a person “said” something. Specifically, they said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and,” such as “responded.” (See: Hendiadys)

### “fear”

In several places in the book, the author uses a word from the root “fear,” such as the verb “fear” or the adjective “fearful,” in a specific sense. He uses the word to describe an awe of God that leads to holy living. He is not referring to an emotion and saying that the person is afraid of God. He means that the person respects and obeys God. Notes will call attention to this usage where it occurs, and they will suggest translations such as the verb “respect” and the adjective “respectful.” (See: Idiom)

### “behold”

In many places in the book, characters use the term “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation in these instances.

### “nose”

In several places in the book, various characters use the term “nose” to mean anger. They do this by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.”

## Job - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 718630)

Job 1 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Wealth

In the time and place in which the book of Job is set, a person’s wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. The book describes how Job owned thousands of animals in order to indicate that he was very rich. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### Sacrifices

Job was a man who obeyed Yahweh carefully. We might therefore wonder why he offered sacrifices on behalf of his children, as 1:5 describes, since he was not one of the descendants of Aaron, who were the only ones whom the law of Moses allowed to offer sacrifices. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the time when God gave Moses the law, so his religious practices were different from those of the Hebrew people after Moses. In Job’s culture, it was normal and acceptable for the father to act as a priest for his family and to offer sacrifices on their behalf. The events that this book relates took place about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than with the rest of the Old Testament. (See:Godly and Law of Moses)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “the adversary”

The Hebrew word satan means “adversary.” The Old Testament uses the word in that sense in several places, for example, 1 Kings 11:14, “Yahweh raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.” In chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job, there is a character called “the satan” or “the adversary.” This seems to be a created angelic being who opposes righteous people and accuses them before God of having wrong motives. Many interpreters of the book of Job identify this character with Satan, the devil. The UST follows that interpretation, but the ULT translates the term more basically as “adversary.” You can decide how to translate this term in your own translation.

## Job 1:1 (#1) (id: 269159)

**"There was a man in the land of Uz"**

The author is introducing **Job** as the main participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who lived in the land of Uz”

See: Introduction of New and Old Participants

## Job 1:1 (#3) (id: 269161)

**"blameless and righteous"**

The terms **blameless** and **righteous** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very righteous”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:1 (#4) (id: 269162)

**"both fearful of God"**

As the General Introduction to Job discusses, here as in several other places in the book, the author is using a word from the root “fear,” in this case the word **fearful**, in a particular sense. He is describing an awe of God that leads to holy living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “both respectful of God”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:1 (#5) (id: 269163)

**"and turning from evil"**

The author is speaking figuratively of Job as if he physically **turned** away from evil. He means that he did not live in an evil way but instead lived in the right way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and careful not to do anything wrong”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:2 (#1) (id: 269164)

**"Seven sons and three daughters were born to him"**

Here and through verse 5, the author is introducing background information about **Job** that will help readers understand what happens later in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

See: Background Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Background Information (ID: `33415@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:2 (#2) (id: 269165)

**"Seven sons and three daughters were born to him"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Job had seven sons and three daughters”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:3 (#1) (id: 269166)

**"the sons of the East"**

The expression **sons of** describes people who share a certain quality. In this case, the author is using the expression to describe people who have the quality of living in **the East**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in the East”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:3 (#2) (id: 269167)

**"the sons of the East"**

The author is referring to an area to the **East** of where he and his audience live. It seems probable that he may mean the area east of the Jordan River, as the UST suggests. However, since it is not known exactly where the author and his audience lived, you could also use a general expression rather than try to identify the area in your translation. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in that area”

## Job 1:4 (#1) (id: 269168)

**"And his sons went and made a feast, a man in {his} house on his day"**

The author is using the expression **went and** to describe customary action. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His sons had the custom of taking turns hosting feasts in their homes”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:4 (#3) (id: 269170)

**"and they sent and called"**

The terms **sent** and **called** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and they invited”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:5 (#1) (id: 269171)

**"when the days of the feast had gone around"**

The author is speaking as if the **days of the feast** had literally **gone around** or traveled a certain distance and then returned to their starting point. He means that each son had taken his turn hosting a feast. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “after the days of the feast had made a full circuit” or “after each son had taken his turn hosting a feast”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:5 (#2) (id: 269172)

**"my sons"**

Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is likely using the word in a generic sense to refer to all of his sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, as the UST does, or you could mention both sons and daughters. Alternate translation: “my sons and daughters”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: `33276@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:5 (#3) (id: 269173)

**"and blessed"**

It is possible that the original reading here was “cursed” and that scribes changed it to **blessed** in order to avoid the uncomfortable language of a person cursing God. Traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible do not have a marginal notation about this as they do in the case of [7:20](https://ref.ly/Job7:20), but many translations read “cursed” since this is the kind of change that scribes are known to have made in similar cases. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT. Alternate translation: “and cursed”

* **Associated Articles:** Euphemism (ID: `33268@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:5 (#4) (id: 269174)

**"have sinned and blessed"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **sinned** tells in what way one of Job’s children might have **blessed**, that is, “cursed” God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “have sinfully cursed”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:5 (#6) (id: 269176)

**"all the days"**

The author says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “on a regular basis”

* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: `33281@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:6 (#1) (id: 269177)

**"And it was the day, and the sons of God came"**

The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day the sons of God came”

See: Introduction of a New Event

This expression describes spiritual beings whom God created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the angelic beings”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:6 (#3) (id: 269179)

**"to present themselves to Yahweh"**

The context suggests that these angelic beings came to Yahweh at regular times to report on their activities. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to give Yahweh a regular report on their activities”

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: `33391@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:7 (#1) (id: 269181)

**"And the adversary answered Yahweh and said"**

As the General Introduction to Job discusses, this phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose the adversary **said** this. If it would be more natural in your language, here and in the rest of the book you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “The adversary responded to Yahweh”

See: Hendiadys

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:7 (#2) (id: 269182)

**"From wandering on the earth and from going back and forth on it"**

These two phrases mean similar things. The adversary is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “From wandering all over the earth”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 1:8 (#2) (id: 269184)

**"there is} not like him"**

This expression leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “there is not anyone like him”

## Job 1:9 (#1) (id: 269188)

**"Does Job fear God for nothing"**

The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Job gets a lot in return for fearing God!”

**"Have you not put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that {is} his, from every side"**

The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation.

**"Have you not put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that {is} his, from every side"**

The adversary is speaking as if God had literally **put a hedge** around Job and his possessions. He means that God has protected Job and all that he owns. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have you not protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side?” or “You have protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side!”

**"You have blessed the works of his hands, and his cattle have burst forth in the land"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “His cattle have burst forth in the land because you have blessed the works of his hands”

## Job 1:10 (#4) (id: 269193)

**"the works of his hands"**

The adversary is using one part of Job, **his hands**, to mean all of Job in the act of doing **works**, specifically the activity of raising cattle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything he has done”

## Job 1:10 (#5) (id: 269194)

**"and his cattle have burst forth in the land"**

The adversary is speaking as if Job’s **cattle** have literally **burst forth** and covered **the land** as if they were floodwaters. He means that Job’s cattle have increased greatly in number. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his herds of cattle have become very large”

**"just stretch out your hand and touch all that {is} his, if he will not bless you to your face"**

The terms **stretch out** and **touch** are imperatives, but they communicate an assertion rather than commands. Use a form in your language that communicates an assertion. Alternate translation: “if you stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, he will bless you to your face”

**"and he was sitting in the midst of the ash pile"**

In this culture, there was place outside the city where rubbish was brought and burned to dispose of it. This left a pile of ashes. Job was sitting in that pile as a symbolic action to show how distressed he was. It was a way of signifying that he no longer felt his life was worth anything. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of his action. Alternate translation: “he was sitting in the midst of the ash pile outside the city to show how distressed he was”

Job 3 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Rhetorical questions

In many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: Rhetorical Question)

### Birth meaning life by association

Throughout this chapter, Job is saying that does not feel that his life is worth living any longer. He communicates this by cursing the day he was born, which is a way of saying by association that he wishes he had never lived. This is a powerful poetic device that would be good to show to your readers, so it would be preferable to translate the device itself, rather than express only its meaning or implications in your translation. In other words, for example, it would be appropriate to translate Job’s actual words in 3:3, “May the day on which I was born perish,” rather than have him say something like, “I do not feel that my life is worth living any more, and so I wish I had never been born.” (See: When to Keep Information Implicit)

## Job 3:5 (#1) (id: 269286)

**"May darkness and a dark shadow claim it"**

The terms **darkness** and **dark shadow** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “May darkness completely claim it”

**"the blacknesses of the day"**

In this possessive form, **the day** is the object rather than the subject of **blacknesses**. That is, this does not mean blacknesses that the day possesses, it means all the things that blacken a day, that is, make it dark.

## Job 3:6 (#4) (id: 269296)

**""May it not rejoice among the days of the year;"**

Job is not saying that he does not want the day of his birth to be one of the months of the year. Rather, he is using the possessive form **the number of the months** to mean the group of all of the months. In other words, that is another way of saying “the year.” Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year; indeed, may it not be part of the year at all” or, combining the two phrases, “May that day be left out of the year completely”

He means that he does not want that night to have any children, in the sense that he does not want any more children to be conceived on that night or, as the context suggests, born on that night.

**"the ones cursing a day"**

Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **the ones cursing a day** he is referring to sorcerers. People in this culture employed sorcerers in the belief that they could cause bad things to happen on a particular day to their enemies. For example, people might employ a sorcerer to try to ruin the day on which a person began an important journey or celebrated an important family occasion such as a wedding.

The implication is that if sorcerers created chaos by awakening the chaos monster, there would no longer be any distinction between days, and so the day of Job’s birth would no longer have a distinct identity. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to cause chaos among days” or “to destroy the distinct identity of the day on which I was born”

## Job 3:8 (#5) (id: 269305)

**"Leviathan"**

As the General Introduction to Job explains, ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean, which they called the “sea monster.” People in Job's culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos, and they associated this sea monster with that chaos. That is the association that Job is making here, calling the sea monster by the name Leviathan. You could retain the name Leviathan in your translation. Alternatively, you could use a general expression to convey the idea here. Alternate translation: “the sea monster that is associated with chaos”

## Job 3:11 (#1) (id: 269316)

**""Why did I not die from the womb,"**

These two phrases mean similar things. As Job and the other characters do throughout the poetic sections of the book, here he is using repeating phrases in order to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (See the discussion of “parallelism” in the General Introduction to the book of Job.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. However, you may wish to retain both of them in order to give your readers an idea of how Hebrew poetry worked. The following notes give suggestions for how to do that.

Job 4 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter (and the next chapter), Job’s friend Eliphaz responds to what Job said in chapter 3\.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Eliphaz’s advice

Eliphaz advises Job to trust that God protects innocent people and punishes wicked people. He says that God corrects good people if they begin to do bad things, and he encourages Job to consider why God is correcting him. Ordinarily this would be very good advice. But Eliphaz does not understand the special circumstances that Job is in. Job himself does not understand them. God cannot explain to Job that he has allowed the adversary to test him to see whether he will still trust God even if he loses his family, possessions, and health, because if God explained this, that would make the test invalid. So this section of the book, in which Job’s three friends speak with him, presents a paradox: What would ordinarily be good advice is not good advice under these special circumstances.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Rhetorical questions

Eliphaz often uses the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate his questions as statements or exclamations. Notes will offer suggestions at each place where Eliphaz uses the question form in this way. (See: Rhetorical Question)

**""If a word is tried with you, will you tire?"**

In both of these sentences, Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis.

Job 5 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend Eliphaz.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### long sentence

Eliphaz describes God in a long sentence in verses 8–13\. As the notes suggest at several places, it may be helpful to break up this long sentence into several shorter sentences.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1

## Job 5:1 (#1) (id: 269422)

**"Call out now"**

Eliphaz is using the word translated **now** to offer polite encouragement. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call out”

See: Politeness

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Politeness (ID: `33423@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:1 (#2) (id: 269423)

**"Call out now"**

Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **Call out**, he is telling Job to ask someone to listen to his complaint against God. In this culture, someone who had a case against someone else would go to a public area and ask established members of the community to hear and judge the case. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:1 (#3) (id: 269424)

**"Call out now"**

Eliphaz does not really want Job to **Call out** and ask someone to hear his complaint against God, even though he is telling Job to do that. Eliphaz actually intends to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He wants Job to realize that there is no being who has the wisdom or authority to hear a human being’s complaint against God. Alternate translation: “There is really no point in calling for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”

See: Irony

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Irony (ID: `33288@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:1 (#4) (id: 269425)

**""is there one answering you?"**

In both of these instances, Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “there is no one who will answer you. You cannot turn to any of the holy ones.”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:1 (#5) (id: 269426)

**"of the holy ones"**

In this context, the phrase **the holy ones** likely refers to angelic beings rather than to people who live righteously. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “of the angelic beings”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:1 (#6) (id: 269427)

**"will you turn"**

Eliphaz is speaking as if Job would literally **turn** to face someone whom he wanted to hear his case against God. Eliphaz means that Job would appeal to such a person, although he is arguing that there actually is no such person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will you appeal”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:2 (#1) (id: 269428)

**"For"**

Eliphaz is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he does not really think that Job should look for someone to judge his complaint against God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “You should not look for someone to judge your complaint against God, because”

* **Associated Articles:** Connecting Words and Phrases (ID: `33335@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:2 (#2) (id: 269429)

**""indignation kills the foolish,"**

Eliphaz is speaking of **indignation** and **resentment** as if they were a living things that could kill a person. He means that people who become indignant and resentful when God corrects them, rather than admitting their sins and repenting, put themselves in a position where God has to punish them, even by killing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when people foolishly become indignant or naïvely become resentful when God corrects them, God must punish or even kill them”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:2
* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:2 (#3) (id: 269430)

**"indignation"** \- **"resentment"**

* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:2 (#6) (id: 269433)

**"and"** \- **"the one being simple"**

Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **simple** he means a person who does not realize that the world is a complicated place and that he needs to cultivate godly wisdom in order to make good choices and avoid the consequences of bad choices. Your language may have a term with this meaning that you could use in your translation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 5:2
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 5:3 (#1) (id: 269434)

**"I myself have seen"**

For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **have seen**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of expressing this emphasis. The ULT does so by saying **I myself**. Alternate translation: “I have indeed seen”

**"whose harvest the hungry one devours"**

## Job 5:5 (#2) (id: 269445)

**"whose harvest the hungry one devours"**

Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **devours the harvest** he is referring to the practice of gleaning, which the law of Moses commanded the Israelites to allow. Poor people could come into harvested fields and pick up the leftover grain to feed themselves. Eliphaz means that the foolish person and his family will not be able to harvest the grain they have planted and so gleaners will come and take all the grain. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “The foolish person has to abandon the grain that he plants in his fields, and gleaners come and take all of it”

**"whose harvest the hungry one devours"**

While hungry people eventually will **devour** or eat up all of the grain from the foolish person’s harvest, Eliphaz means in this context that they will take all of the grain from the fields.

**"the hungry one"** \- **"the thirsty ones"**

Eliphaz is using the adjectives **hungry** and **thirsty** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. The ULT adds the words **one** and **ones** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “the hungry person … thirsty people”

**"they even take it from among the thorns"**

The implications are that if gleaners even collect the grain that is growing **among the thorns** in the foolish person’s field, then they will take all of the grain in the entire field. The further implication is that nothing will be left for the foolish person and his family. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they take every last bit of grain, leaving nothing for him and his family”

**"For"**

Eliphaz is using the word **For** to connect what he has just said with his larger argument that Job should consider why God would be punishing him.

**""misery does not come out from the dust,"**

Eliphaz is speaking as if **misery** and **trouble** might literally come from the **dust** or the **ground**. He is comparing them to plants such as weeds that might unexpectedly appear in the soil even though a farmer did not sow their seeds.

**""man is born to trouble,"**

Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by naming two things that he holds to be true, he means that the first is just as true as the second. You could indicate that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “man is born to trouble, just as surely as sons of the flame soar to fly”

**"great {things}"** \- **"marvelous {things"**

Eliphaz is using the adjectives **great** and **marvelous** as nouns to mean certain kinds of things. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

## Job 5:25 (#2) (id: 269522)

**"and your offspring, like the grass of the earth"**

Eliphaz is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and that your offspring will be like the grass of the earth”

## Job 5:25 (#3) (id: 269523)

**"and your offspring, like the grass of the earth"**

The point of this comparison is that just as **the grass of the earth** is very plentiful, so Job will have a large number of offspring. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and that your offspring will be very numerous, like the grass of the earth”

## Job 5:26 (#1) (id: 269524)

**"You will come to the grave"**

Eliphaz is using the expression **come to the grave** to mean “die.” This is a poetic way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “You will depart this world”

## Job 5:26 (#2) (id: 269525)

**"like the lifting of a stack of grain in its time"**

The point of this comparison is that when Job’s time comes to die, he will have lived a full and rewarding life, just as a **stack of grain** that is harvested **in its time** is ripe and fully developed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “mature and accomplished, like grain that is harvested at the peak of ripeness”

## Job 5:27 (#1) (id: 269526)

**"We have examined it"**

By **We**, Eliphaz means himself and other wise people but not Job, to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Job 5:27 (#2) (id: 269527)

**"and know {it"**

For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and know it certainly”

## Job - Chapter 6 Introduction (id: 718635)

Job 6 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Metaphors

Job uses many different metaphors in this chapter to express his pain or despair and to show that he is upset with his friends, people who are supposed to help him during difficult times. (See: Metaphor)

In verses 16–20, Job develops the image of his friends being like a stream of water that runs dry. Since Job explains the meaning of the image again in verse 21, you do not need to explain it in your translation in verses 16–20\.

### Rhetorical questions

Job often uses the question form in this chapter to make emphatic statements or exclamations. This emphasis helps strengthen Job’s response to Eliphaz. (See: Rhetorical Question)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### plural “you”

Beginning in verse 21, Job addresses his friends directly. So when he uses the word **you** from that verse to the end of the chapter, the word is plural. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Job 6:2 (#1) (id: 269528)

**""If only my anguish, being weighed, were weighed,"**

Job is speaking as if his **anguish** and **calamity** could literally be **weighed**. He means that he wishes he could prove that his calamity is so great that it justifies the anguish he is feeling and has been expressing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I wish I could prove that my calamity warrants the amount of anguish that I am feeling and showing”

## Job 6:2 (#2) (id: 269529)

**""If only my anguish, being weighed, were weighed,"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “If only someone would weigh my anguish thoroughly and lay my calamity in the balances”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:2 (#3) (id: 269530)

**""If only my anguish, being weighed, were weighed,"**

The word **balances** describes an instrument for determining the weight of an object or comparing the weight of two objects. It consists of a central post with a crossbar from which two pans are hung. An object may be placed in one pan and known weights placed in the other pan until the crossbar remains level, meaning that both pans contain an equal weight. Or one object may be placed in one pan and a different object in the other pan; the pan that hangs lower contains the heavier object. If your readers would not be familiar with what **balances** are, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “If only someone would weigh both my anguish and my calamity on a scale”

## Job 6:2 (#4) (id: 269531)

**"being weighed, were weighed"**

The words **were thoroughly weighed** translate a repeated verb. Job is repeating the verb “weigh” for emphasis. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.

## Job 6:3 (#1) (id: 269532)

**"it would be heavier than the sand of the seas"**

Job is using the pronoun **it** to refer to his anguish. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my anguish would be heavier than the sand of the seas”

**"my words raved"**

Job is speaking of his **words** as if they were a living thing that has **raved** to his friends. He means that he himself has raved or spoken vehemently to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I raved when I spoke to you”

## Job 6:4 (#1) (id: 269534)

**""the arrows of the Almighty are in me,"**

Job is speaking as if God had literally shot **arrows** with **poison** into him. He means that the bad things that have happened to him, for which he considers God responsible, are making him suffer and feel desperate, as if he were dying from the poison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am suffering desperately because of what the Almighty has done to me”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 6:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:4 (#2) (id: 269535)

**""the arrows of the Almighty are in me,"**

Job is using the possessive form to refer to an inner part of himself, the locus of his motivations and aspirations, as his **spirit**. He is not referring to a separate supernatural being, a spirit, that belongs to him. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “my morale is suffering desperately because of what the Almighty has done to me”

**"is drinking"**

Job is speaking as if his **spirit** were literally **drinking** poison from arrows that had struck him. He means, within the context of that metaphor, that his spirit is absorbing the poison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is absorbing”

## Job 6:4 (#4) (id: 269537)

**"the terrors of God array themselves against me"**

Job is speaking of **the terrors of God** (that is, the things he believes God is doing to terrify him) as if they were living things that could **array themselves** against him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God is doing many things that all terrify me”

## Job 6:5 (#1) (id: 269538)

**""Does a wild donkey bray over grass?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis in both of these sentences. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “A wild donkey does not bray over grass! Indeed, an ox does not bellow over its fodder!”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 6:5
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:5 (#2) (id: 269539)

**"If an ox bellows over its fodder"**

Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “An ox does not bellow over its fodder, does it?”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 6:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:5 (#3) (id: 269540)

**""Does a wild donkey bray over grass?"**

Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as animals do not complain loudly if they have food, so Job would not be protesting so vehemently if something were not seriously wrong. But since Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If your readers would not recognize what a **wild donkey** or an **ox** is, in your translation you could use animals that your readers would recognize.

## Job 6:6 (#1) (id: 269541)

**""Will the unsavory be eaten without salt?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis in both of these sentences. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “The unsavory will not be eaten without salt! And there is no taste in the white of an egg!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:6 (#2) (id: 269542)

**""Will the unsavory be eaten without salt?"**

Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as it is necessary to season some foods in order to eat them, so it is necessary to talk expressively about some situations in life in order to endure them. Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), but perhaps the connection will not be as clear in this case as in the previous verse. So you could make the connection more explicitly. Alternatively, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that would be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If people in your culture would not eat **the white of an egg**, in your translation you could use a food that your readers would recognize. Alternate translation: “I cannot endure these troubles without talking emotionally about them, any more than people can eat bland food without seasoning it”

* **Associated Articles:** Proverbs (ID: `33425@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:6 (#3) (id: 269543)

**"Will the unsavory be eaten without salt"**

Job is using the adjective **unsavory,** which in this context means “without flavor,” as a noun to mean a certain kind of food. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will unsavory food be eaten without salt”

## Job 6:7 (#1) (id: 269546)

**"My soul has refused"**

Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have refused”

* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 6:7 (#2) (id: 269547)

**"to touch"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is moving from quoting a proverb that uses food as an illustration to talking about his actual food. Alternate translation: “to touch food”

**"are} like disease {in} my food"**

The point of this comparison is that just as **disease** can make a person feel too badly to eat, so Job’s troubles are making him feel too badly to eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “are making me feel too badly to eat, as if I were sick”

**"Who will grant that my request may come"**

**"and may God be willing and may he crush me"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and**. The verb **be willing** tells in what way Job hopes God will **crush** him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “and may God willingly crush me” or “and may God agree to crush me”

**""Yet may it still be my consolation—"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the last phrase in this sentence first, since it gives the reason for what the first and second phrases describe.

**""**

In this verse, Job describes the state of desert streams in the cold season, and in the next verse, he contrasts that with the state of the streams in the hot season. To show this contrast, you could create a verse bridge for verses 16–17\. It might say something like this: “In the cold season, these streams are dark from ice over their channel, indeed, snow covers that channel. But in the hot season, the streams go dry and vanish, the heat dries them up completely”

## Job - Chapter 7 Introduction (id: 718636)

Job 7 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Job finishes responding to Eliphaz’s first speech, and he also addresses God directly in light of his exchange with Eliphaz.

* Verses 1–6: Job continues to respond to Elilphaz
* Verses 7–21: Job addresses God directly

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Metaphors

Job uses many different images in this chapter to describe what the things are like that he is feeling and experiencing. (See: Metaphor)

### Rhetorical questions

Job often uses the question form in this chapter to emphasize the points he is making to Eliphaz and to God. Notes suggest how these questions may be translated as statements or exclamations if that would be more natural in your language. (See: Rhetorical Question)

## Job 7:1 (#4) (id: 269629)

**"And {are"** \- **"his days like the days of a hireling"**

Job is using this comparison to say that just as **the days of a hireling** (that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor) are long and difficult, so his days are long and difficult. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “Yes, his days are long and difficult, like those of a hireling!”

## Job 7:2 (#1) (id: 269630)

**""As a slave longs for shade,"**

The point of this comparison, as Job makes clear in the next verse, is that just as a **slave** and a **hireling** have to endure long periods of wishing for relief, so Job has gone a long time without relief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “As a slave wishes all through a long, hot day that evening would come, and as a hireling must wait until the end of the day to be paid”

## Job 7:3 (#1) (id: 269632)

**"I have been caused to inherit months of futility"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has caused me to inherit months of futility”

## Job 7:3 (#4) (id: 269635)

**"I have been caused to inherit months of futility"**

From the narrative of the book of Job, it does not appear that at this point **months** have gone by since Job began to experience his terrible misfortunes.

## Job 7:3 (#5) (id: 269636)

**"and they have appointed nights of trouble to me"**

The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Job is using this indefinite construction to focus on what has been **appointed** to him rather than on who appointed it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun.

Alternate translation: “I hope this will not be a long and difficult night!”

A **shuttle** is a wooden tool that weavers use when weaving to store and unravel yarn while passing it back and forth through other threads of yarn mounted on a loom.

## Job 7:7 (#1) (id: 269648)

**"Remember"**

To this point in the speech he began in [6:1](https://ref.ly/Job6:1), Job has been addressing his three friends, and so the pronoun **you** has been plural and the imperative forms have been second\-person plural. However, the imperative **Remember** here is singular because Job is now addressing God, as he will do for the rest of this speech. So use a second\-person singular imperative in your translation if your language marks that distinction. You may also wish to indicate explicitly that Job is now addressing God. Alternate translation: “God, remember”

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 7:7
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 7:7 (#2) (id: 269649)

**"Remember"**

This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please remember”

**""Why will you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these sentences, since in the second sentence Job gives the reason for what he says in the first sentence that God should do.

## Job - Chapter 8 Introduction (id: 718637)

Job 8 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad responds to what Job said in chapters 6 and 7\.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Bildad answering Job with his own words

In [7:21](https://ref.ly/Job7:21), at the end of his speech, Job suggested that God might **seek** for him **diligently**. Bildad says in his response in [8:5](https://ref.ly/Job8:5) that it is actually Job who should be seeking God diligently. To help your readers appreciate how Bildad is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Bildad’s expression **seek diligently** the same way that you translated it when Job used it in [7:21](https://ref.ly/Job7:21).

### Quotation within a quotation

In his speech, Bildad encourages Job to consider the wisdom of their ancestors. In verses 11–22, he may be quoting from traditional teachings. Notes suggest the possibility of punctuating these verses as a secondary quotation if your language might naturally put one direct quotation inside another.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 8:1

## Job 8:2 (#1) (id: 269699)

**""Until when will you say these things,"**

Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Until when will you say these things, and until when will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind”

* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: `33267@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:2 (#2) (id: 269700)

**""Until when will you say these things,"**

Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not keep saying these things, and the words of your mouth should not keep being a mighty wind!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:2 (#3) (id: 269701)

**"the words of your mouth"**

Bildad is using the term **mouth** to mean speaking, by association with the way people use their mouths to speak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the words that you speak” or see next note for another possibility.

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 8:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:2 (#4) (id: 269702)

**"the words of your mouth"**

It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “your words” or “what you say”

## Job 8:2 (#5) (id: 269703)

**"and"** \- **"be} a mighty wind"**

Bildad is speaking as if the **words** of Job were literally a **mighty wind**. He means that Job is saying many things insistently, but they are not substantial. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and … be so insistent but so insubstantial”

## Job 8:3 (#1) (id: 269704)

**""Does God pervert justice?"**

If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **justice** and **righteousness**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “Does God do things that are not just? Does the Almighty do things that are not righteous?”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 8:3
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:3 (#2) (id: 269705)

**""Does God pervert justice?"**

Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God does not pervert justice! No, the Almighty does not pervert righteousness!” or, positively, “God always does what is just! Yes, the Almighty always does what is righteous!”

## Job 8:4 (#1) (id: 269706)

**"then he put them in the hand of their sins"**

In this context, to be **in the hand of** someone or something means to be under the power or control of that person or thing.

## Job 8:4 (#2) (id: 269707)

**"then he put them in the hand of their sins"**

Bildad is speaking as if the **sins** of Job’s **children** were a living thing that had exerted power over them and killed them. He actually means that God killed Job’s children in order to punish them for their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then God punished them by killing them for the sins they committed”

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:5 (#1) (id: 269708)

**"If you seek diligently for God"**

For emphasis, Bildad is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **seek diligently**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “If you seek diligently for God yourself”

## Job 8:6 (#1) (id: 269710)

**"pure and upright"**

The terms **pure** and **upright** mean similar things. Bildad is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “truly righteous”

* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:6 (#2) (id: 269711)

**"he will rouse himself for you"**

One possible meaning of the expression translated **rouse himself** is “wake up.” If there is already a Bible translation in your region, it may say something like this. Bildad could be speaking as if God were sleeping and would literally wake up at the realization that Job needed and deserved help. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will come quickly to help you”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 8:6
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:6 (#3) (id: 269712)

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 8:7 (#1) (id: 269714)

**""Though your beginning was small,"**

Since, as [1:3](https://ref.ly/Job1:3) states, Job was previously the greatest man in a vast area, it is not the case that his **beginning**, that is, his former condition, was **small**. Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of what he is saying. He means that Job’s former state, great though it was, will seem small by comparison with the much greater prosperity that Job will experience in the future if he seeks God diligently. Alternate translation: “Though your former state was great, your future will be so much greater that the former state will seem as if it had been small”

**"we {are} of yesterday and we do not know"**

Bildad is saying that he, Job, and the other two friends were only born **yesterday** and that they do **not know** anything. He says both of these things as overstatements for emphasis.

**"our days on earth {are} a shadow"**

Bildad is speaking as if the **days** that he and Job and the other friends have **on earth** were literally a **shadow**. He means that just as a shadow appears only for a short time, so people are only on earth for a short time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

**""Will they not teach you? They will speak to you,"**

Bildad is speaking as if Job’s ancestors would **teach** him and **speak to** him. He does not mean this literally. Instead, he means that Job can learn from the accumulated wisdom that has been passed down to them from their ancestors through tradition. Bildad will summarize this traditional teaching in the rest of his speech. Particularly if there is a practice of ancestor worship in your culture, be sure to make this meaning clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “You can learn much from the traditional teachings we have received from them. It would be as if they were speaking to you and bringing forth words from their hearts”

He is using the word **hearts** to mean a person’s thoughts and emotions. He is saying that through tradition the ancestors have passed down their most cherished beliefs and the most profound lessons they learned in life. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they will share with you their most cherished insights”

**""Does papyrus grow without a marsh?"**

From here to the end of the chapter, Bildad may be quoting the teaching of the ancestors. This would be a second\-level quotation, since the book is already quoting Bildad’s speech.

**"in its greenness"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **greenness**, you could express the same idea in another way.

Bildad is speaking of the plant’s location as if it were a living thing that could recognize things and speak. The meaning of this phrase is similar to the meaning of the phrase “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](https://ref.ly/Job7:10). In this case, Bildad is saying that the plant will be so thoroughly removed that its former location will be convinced that it was never there to begin with.

Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He is speaking in this way for emphasis. He does not mean that the godless person has actual **joy**.

## Job - Chapter 9 Introduction (id: 718638)

Job 9 General Notes
===================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s first speech. In [8:5](https://ref.ly/Job8:5), Bildad told Job that he should appeal to God. In response, Job protests in this chapter that a human being cannot appeal to God.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Litany

In verses 5–10, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:

God is wise in heart and mighty in strength (Who has hardened himself against him and been whole?),

> the one removing mountains and they do not know, who overturns them in his anger, the one shaking the earth from its place and causing its pillars to tremble, the one speaking to the sun and it does not rise, and upon the stars he seals, stretching out the heavens by himself and treading on the waves of the sea, making the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south, doing great {things} until there is no searching and distinguished {things} until there is no number.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:1

## Job 9:2 (#1) (id: 269763)

**"But how will a man be righteous with God"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But a man cannot be righteous with God!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:2 (#2) (id: 269764)

**"a man"**

Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:2
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: `33276@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:3 (#1) (id: 269765)

**"If he desires to contend with him"**

In this part of the verse, the pronoun **he** refers to “a man” and the pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “If a person desires to contend with God”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:3
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:3 (#2) (id: 269766)

**"to contend with him"**

Job assumes that Bildad will understand that he is using the word **contend** to mean making a formal legal complaint against God. In this culture, people made such complaints to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party would question the other in the presence of the leaders, who would then discuss the case and decide how to resolve it. Job is probably describing how he participated as a leader in such cases in [29:21–23](https://ref.ly/Job29:21-Job29:23). Your language may have an expression for this process that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to take God to court” or “to file charges against God”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:3 (#3) (id: 269767)

**"he will not answer him"**

In this part of the verse, (1\) the pronoun **he** could refer to a human being and the pronoun **him** could refer to God. This seems likely, since after describing God’s knowledge and power, Job asks in [9:14](https://ref.ly/Job9:14) how he could possibly answer God and in [9:32](https://ref.ly/Job9:32) he says that God is “not a man, as I am, that I could answer him.” Alternate translation: “a human will not answer God” (2\) the pronoun **he** could refer to God and the pronoun **him** could refer to a human being. This is also a possibility, since Job protests in [30:20](https://ref.ly/Job30:20) that God does not answer him. Alternate translation: “God will not answer a human”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:3
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:3 (#4) (id: 269768)

**"he will not answer him"**

If Job means that a human will not answer God, then he is using the future tense to describe what a person would be able to do. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “he could not answer him” or “he would not be able to answer him”

See: Statements — Other Uses

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 9:3
* **Associated Articles:** Statements — Other Uses (ID: `33263@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:3 (#5) (id: 269769)

**"one from a thousand"**

The expression **not … one from a thousand** (that is, not one time out of a thousand) is an overstatement for emphasis. It is unlikely that one party in a court case would ask the other party as many as a thousand questions. Job means that a person would not find a single way to answer God satisfactorily no matter how many questions God asked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no matter how many questions he asks”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:4 (#3) (id: 269772)

**"and mighty in strength"**

The terms **mighty** and **strength** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and very strong”

* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:4 (#4) (id: 269773)

**"Who has hardened himself against him and been whole"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No person has ever hardened himself against God and been whole!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 9:4 (#5) (id: 269774)

**"has hardened himself against him"**

Job is likely referring to bringing charges against God when he speaks of a person who has **hardened himself against** God, since a person who brings charges has determined not to show mercy. Rather, that person has decided to demand justice. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has brought charges against him”

## Job 9:4 (#6) (id: 269775)

**"and been whole"**

By **whole**, Job probably means not suffering any damages, that is, winning a court case and having the other party pay compensation, rather than having to pay compensation oneself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and won the case”

## Job 9:5 (#3) (id: 269778)

**"and they do not know"**

This could mean: (1\) that the **mountains** do not know that God is about to remove them. In that case Job would be speaking of the mountains as if they were living things that could **know** something that was about to happen. (2\) that people in general do not know that God is about to remove the mountains. In that case **they** would be an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Either way, the idea is that God removes mountains without anyone or anything knowing in advance. Alternate translation: “suddenly” or “unexpectedly”

## Job 9:5 (#4) (id: 269779)

**"in his nose"**

As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Job is using the term **nose** to mean anger by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “in his anger”

Alternate translation: “and causing it to tremble from deep underground”

## Job 9:7 (#1) (id: 269781)

**"the one speaking to the sun and it does not rise"**

Job is speaking as if the **sun** literally did not **rise** on certain days. He most likely means that the sun is not visible on those days because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who determines whether the sun will shine or clouds will cover it”

## Job 9:8 (#1) (id: 269783)

**""stretching out the heavens by himself"**

People in this culture believed that the **heavens** (that is, the sky) were a solid object that God had stretched out over a framework in order to cover the earth. For example, [40:22](https://ref.ly/Isa40:22) says, “He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” You could retain the reference to God **stretching out the heavens** in your translation, and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God alone created the sky and treads on the waves of the sea”

**"and treading on the waves of the sea"**

As a note to [7:12](https://ref.ly/Job7:12) explains, people in this culture considered the **sea** to be the realm of chaos. When Job speaks of God **treading on the waves of the sea**, he is speaking as if God were literally trampling down the forces of chaos with his feet. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and subduing the watery forces of chaos”

## Job 9:9 (#2) (id: 269786)

**"and the chambers of the south"**

People in this culture believed that God kept natural forces in **chambers**. For example, [Psalm 19:4–5](https://ref.ly/Ps19:4-Ps19:5) says that God has “pitched a tent for the sun” in the sky, from which the sun comes forth “like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” [135:7](https://ref.ly/Ps37:9) refers similarly to God bringing the wind out of his “storehouses.” In [Job 37:9](https://ref.ly/Job37:9), Elihu says that “the storm comes from its chamber.” So the reference here to **the chambers of the south** is likely to a place where, it was believed, God kept all the constellations of stars and from which God brought them out each night. You could retain the reference to these **chambers** in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is likely referring to the constellations themselves by association with their **chambers**. Alternate translation: “and all the other constellations”

**"They glide with boats of papyrus"**

Job is speaking as if the days of his life literally **glide** across the water together with **boats of papyrus**. As in the previous verse, he means that his days move very quickly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am running out of days as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water” or “Each of my days goes by as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water”

**"I would fear all my sorrows"**

Job is speaking implicitly of the **sorrows** he knows he would still experience when God punished him for the things God would consider him guilty of doing.

## Job 9:28 (#3) (id: 269840)

**"you would not acquit me"**

The pronoun **you** is singular because it refers to God rather than to the three friends. So use the second\-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Even though to this point in this speech Job has been protesting that he cannot argue his case with God, here he addresses God directly, as he did in [7:7–21](https://ref.ly/Job7:7-Job7:21) and as he will do later in this speech in [10:2–22](https://ref.ly/Job10:2-Job10:22).

If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means and convey the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “God thinks I am wicked!

## Job - Chapter 10 Introduction (id: 718639)

Job 10 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Job finishes responding to Bildad’s first speech. As he did in chapter 7, Job speaks to God in light of his exchange with his friend, although in this case Job describes what he would say to God rather than addressing God directly.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Rhetorical questions

In many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: Rhetorical Question)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Extended quotation

Starting in verse 2 and continuing through the end of the chapter, Job quotes what he would say to God if he could argue his case with him. If your language would not naturally put one direct quotation inside another, you could translate what Job says as an indirect quotation. A note to verse 2 suggests how to start doing that. You could follow the same approach throughout the rest of the chapter.

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 10:1 (#1) (id: 269859)

**"My soul is weary"** \- **"in the bitterness of my soul"**

Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am weary … in my bitterness”

* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 10:1 (#2) (id: 269860)

**"I will abandon my complaint upon myself"**

In this expression, to **abandon** something **upon** oneself means not to restrain it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will complain without restraining myself”

## Job 10:2 (#1) (id: 269861)

**""I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this is the beginning of a long quotation within a quotation. Job is telling his friends what he would like to tell God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this and the rest of the chapter so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I will tell God not to condemn me but to cause me to know for what he is accusing me”

**""I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;"**

If you decide to translate what Job says he would tell God as a direct quotation, you could indicate the start of the quotation with an opening second\-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second\-level quotation.

## Job 10:3 (#1) (id: 269864)

**""Is it good to you that you will oppress {me},"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not consider it good to oppress me, to despise the work of your hands, while you shine on the plans of the wicked!”

## Job 10:5 (#1) (id: 269874)

**""Are} your days like the days of a man?"**

Job is asking implicitly whether God has the same number of **days** and **years** as a human being, not whether God experiences the kind of **days** and **years** that people do. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Is the number of your days the same as the number of the days that a man has, or is the number of your years the same as the number of days that a person has”

**""Are} your days like the days of a man?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations, not continuing this sentence into the following two verses. Alternate translation: “Your days are not like the days of a man! No, your years are not like the days of a person!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 10:5 (#3) (id: 269876)

**""Are} your days like the days of a man?"**

Job is using the terms **days** and **years** to mean by association the lifetime of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two phrases and state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have as short a lifetime as people do” or “You do not have as short a lifetime as people do!”

## Job 10:5 (#4) (id: 269877)

**""a man?"**

In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. Both of these masculine terms have a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a mortal … a human being”

## Job 10:5 (#5) (id: 269878)

**"like the days of"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could say “years” instead of **days** here. This would maintain a parallel between the two parts of this verse without making any significant change in meaning. (The original reading may have been “years”; many translations say that.) Alternate translation: “like the years of”

## Job 10:6 (#1) (id: 269880)

**""that you seek for my iniquity"**

In this verse and the previous one, Job seems to be asking implicitly whether God is seeking urgently to discover whether he has sinned because God has only a short time to live and God wants to discover this before he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Is that why you seek for my iniquity and search for my sin”

## Job 10:6 (#2) (id: 269881)

**""that you seek for my iniquity"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express, to convey his sense that God is seeking urgently to find out whether he has sinned. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “that you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned” or “Is that why you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned”

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the questions there as statements or exclamations, this would be a new sentence.

## Job - Chapter 11 Introduction (id: 718640)

Job 11 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Job’s friend Zophar responds to what Job said in chapters 9 and 10\.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Zophar answering Job with his own words

* In [9:12](https://ref.ly/Job9:12), Job asked about God, when suggesting that God might act cruelly, “Who will turn him back?” Zophar says in his response in [11:10](https://ref.ly/Job11:10), answering Job in his own words to insist that God actually acts justly, ”Who will turn him back?”
* In [10:15](https://ref.ly/Job10:15), Job says that he will not lift his head, he will continue to act ashamed, because God is punishing him even though he is innocent. Zophar says in response in [11:15](https://ref.ly/Job11:15) that if Job repents and prays for forgiveness, he will be able to lift up his face without any shame.
* In [10:22](https://ref.ly/Job10:22), Job says that he will die and go to a place of complete darkness. Zophar says in response in [11:17](https://ref.ly/Job11:17) that Job’s life may seem like darkness now, but it will become bright and happy if he turns to God.

To help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Zophar’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter

### Rhetorical questions

In many places in this chapter, Zophar uses the question form in order to challenge Job. Your language might not use the question form for that purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: Rhetorical Question)

## Job 11:8 (#1) (id: 269956)

**""The height of the heavens! What will you do?"**

Zophar is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language.

This could mean: (1\) that God’s wisdom is completely comprehensive, as if it were literally very long and very wide. Alternate translation: “Yes, God’s wisdom is completely comprehensive” (2\) that God’s wisdom comprehends everything in creation.

**""But an empty man will get a heart"**

For emphasis, Zophar is saying the opposite of what he means. The **colt of a wild donkey** will never be **born to a man**, and so, Zophar means, an **empty man** will never **get a heart**, that is, become wise. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Zophar actually means.

**"If you prepare your heart"**

For emphasis, Zophar is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **prepare**. Zophar is drawing a contrast between what he is suggesting here that Job might do and what the “empty man” he described in the previous verse would not be able to do. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis.

Zophar is suggesting that Job might **stretch out** his **hands** to God as symbolic action in order to assume a posture of prayer.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The word **tents** could be: (1\) an image for Job’s whole life.

**"you will lift your face without blemish"**

Zophar is suggesting that Job would be able to **lift** his **face** without being concerned that any **blemish** would show as symbolic action to indicate that he was not ashamed of anything. Job said in [10:15](https://ref.ly/Job10:15) that he could not do this, and so Zophar is answering Job with his own words. To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate this expression similarly to the way you translated the comparable expression in [10:15](https://ref.ly/Job10:15).

Zophar is speaking of Job’s **life** as if it were literally an object like the sun that could **arise** into the sky. By saying that Job’s life will rise into the sky even higher than the sun at noon, he means that it will be very bright. The brightness, in turn, represents happy thriving.

In a poetic parallel, Zophar is once again using light, in this instance the light of **dawn**, to represent happiness. This contrasts with Job’s present misery, which Zophar represents as **darkness**. Zophar is once again answering Job with his own words. The term translated **darkness** here is from the same root as the term that the ULT translates as “obscurity” in [10:22](https://ref.ly/Job10:22). To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate the term here the same way you translated it there.

Job 12 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the start of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech. (Job’s response to him continues in chapters 13 and 14\.)

* Verses 1–6: Job speaks to all three of his friends and protests that they have not been telling him anything that he does not already know
* Verses 7–12: Job speaks specifically to Zophar and insists that what Zophar has just said in his speech is common knowledge in the world and something that he himself knows.
* Verses 13–25: Job describes how God is so powerful that no one can resist what he does.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Plural and singular “you”

The pronoun “you” is plural in verses 1–3 because Job is addressing all three of his friends. The pronoun “you” is singular in verses 7–8 because Job is addressing Zophar. Use the plural and singular forms in these places if your language marks that distinction.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Litany

In verses 13–24, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:

> With him {are} wisdom and might; to him {are} counsel and understanding. Behold, he breaks down, and it is not rebuilt; he closes upon a man, and it is not opened. Behold, he withholds the waters and they dry up, and he sends them out and they overthrow the land. With him {are} strength and prudence; to him {are} the one straying and the one causing to stray; the one leading counselors away naked, and he makes judges foolish. He removes the bond of kings and he wraps a cloth around their loins; the one leading priests away naked, and the incumbent ones he overthrows, the one removing the lip {that is} to the ones being trusted, and he takes away the discernment of the elders, the one pouring contempt on nobles, and the belt of the mighty ones he loosens, the one revealing deep things out of darkness, and he brings dark shadow into the light, the one magnifying nations, and he destroys them; the one enlarging nations, and he exiles them, the one removing a heart from the leaders of the people of the earth; he causes them to wander in a wasteland {with} no path. They grope in darkness and not in light; he makes them wander like a drunkard.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 12:1

## Job 12:2 (#1) (id: 269994)

**""Truly, then, you {are} the people,"**

For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are speaking as if you were the people and as if wisdom would with you, but that is not true”

See: Irony

* **Associated Articles:** Irony (ID: `33288@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 12:2 (#2) (id: 269995)

**"you {are} the people"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here and in the next two verses because Job is referring to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways to indicate the plural reference. Alternate translation: “the three of you are the people”

## Job 12:2 (#3) (id: 269996)

**"you {are} the people"**

Job could be saying (while meaning the opposite): (1\) that his three friends are so wise that their opinion is the one that really matters. Alternate translation: “you are the people whose opinion matters” (2\) that in their counsel, his three friends are embodying the collective wisdom of their people. Alternate translation: “you have expressed the wisdom of our whole people”

**"and wisdom will die with you"**

Job is speaking of **wisdom** as if it were a living thing that could **die**. He is saying (while meaning the opposite) that his friends are the only people who are truly wise and so there will be no wisdom left on earth once they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and indeed, you are the only wise people on earth”

## Job 12:7 (#1) (id: 270013)

**""But now ask the beasts, and one will teach you,"**

Job is using an imperative sentence to tell the condition under which something would happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this as a conditional sentence. Alternate translation: “But now if you asked the beasts, one of them would teach you, and if you asked the birds of the heavens, one of them would declare to you”

**""But now ask the beasts, and one will teach you,"**

Job is speaking as if Zophar could literally have a conversation with **beasts** and **birds**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 12:7 (#3) (id: 270015)

**"But now ask"**

The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative verb (**ask**) are singular here and in the next verse because Job is speaking directly to one of his friends. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Job is probably addressing Zophar, since he said in [11:8–9](https://ref.ly/Job11:8-Job11:9) that Job could search through all of creation and still not comprehend the wisdom of God. Job is saying in response that God’s ways are common knowledge to animals and birds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “But now, Zophar, ask”

## Job 12:7–8 (#1) (id: 270012)

**""**

In [11:9](https://ref.ly/Job11:9), Zophar used the two main components of creation, the earth and the sea, to mean all of creation. Here in [12:7–8](https://ref.ly/Job12:7-Job12:8), Job is responding to Zophar in his own words. Job's language is more extensive, and so it is more emphatic. Job is using the inhabitants of three components of creation (the beasts of the land, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea), along with the earth itself, to mean all of creation. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 7–8\. It might say something like this: “You can go anywhere in creation and ask a creature—even ask the earth itself—about God’s ways, and that creature will be able to explain them to you”

He is using the ear to represent hearing, and he means that people themselves test or consider the words of others when they hear them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do people not consider others’ words when they hear them, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”

**""Does not the ear test words"**

Though Job is making a general statement, he is referring implicitly to what his friends have said to him and what he has decided about it. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.

**""With the aged {is} wisdom,"**

Though Job is making another general statement in this verse, he is referring implicitly to himself as someone who has acquired much wisdom through long experience. The further implication is that although Zophar challenged him in [11:8](https://ref.ly/Job11:8) by asking, “What will you know?” Job is insisting here that he actually does know a lot about life. You could indicate these things in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.

In that sense, while it sounds as if Job is praising God, at the same time, Job is also complaining somewhat about God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.

**"to him {are} the one straying and the one causing to stray"**

The implication is that if someone is **straying** or doing wrong, that person cannot excuse his actions by saying that someone else persuaded him to do them. The person who chose to do wrong is accountable to God, and anyone who persuaded him to do those wrong is also accountable to God.

## Job 12:17 (#2) (id: 270055)

**"He is} the one leading counselors away naked"**

To lead someone away **naked**, as victorious armies did to prisoners of war at this time, was a symbolic action that demonstrated that the conqueror had deprived the captive of his former status in his culture. In the case of a royal **counselor**, his power and authority were previously represented by his robe of office. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action.

**"He is} the one leading counselors away naked"**

Job is speaking as if God literally leads **counselors** away **naked**. He means that God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans, as if to put them out of office.

**"He removes the bond of kings"**

This could mean implicitly: (1\) that **kings** might put a **bond** (that is, shackles) on someone to make him a prisoner, but God can set that person free. Alternate translation: “A king may imprison someone, but God can set that person free” (2\) that kings may be wearing some symbol of royal authority as a **bond** (that is, as something bound around their bodies), such as a sash or chain, but God takes away their authority and removes this symbol of it.

Job is speaking as if God literally **loosens** the **belt** of **mighty ones**, that is, as if these mighty people tie up their robes so that they can do strenuous things, but God loosens their robes again so that they can not do those things. Job means that God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Job - Chapter 13 Introduction (id: 718642)

Job 13 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.

* Verses 1–19: Job complains to his friends that they have been speaking about him unfairly
* Verses 20–28: Job begins to plead his case to God. He asks God to stop punishing him and to reveal any sins that are causing God to punish him with such great suffering.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

\#\#Translation Issues in This Chapter

### singular and plural “you”

The words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are all plural in verses 1–19 because in those verses Job is addressing his three friends. These forms are singular in verses 20–28 because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the appropriate forms in these different parts of the chapter.

### “lift his face” (verse 8\), “hide your face” (verse 24\)

These expressions reflect a cultural practice. In this culture, the subject of a king would look humbly down at the ground when he came into the king’s presence. If the king was pleased with him, the king would “lift his face,” that is, get him to look up (for example, with a finger under his chin, or with a verbal command) to indicate that he could look at the king directly. In this way the king would be showing that he favored this subject. A reference to lifting someone’s face came to mean showing favoritism towards that person. That is the meaning in verse 8, where Job says that his friends are not considering his case fairly but instead showing partiality towards God. Similarly, if someone “hid his face” from someone (that is, turned his face away so that he was not looking at the person), that would be a sign that he was not pleased with the person. The expression “hide the face” came to mean “show disfavor,” even if someone was not literally looking away from someone else. That is what Job means in verse 24 when he asks God, “Why do you hide your face?” Notes to these verses suggest ways of translating these expressions.

## Job 13:1 (#1) (id: 270075)

**""my eye has seen all;"**

Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. He uses another part of himself, his **ear**, to mean all of him in the act of hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I myself have seen all; I myself have heard and understood it”

## Job 13:2 (#1) (id: 270077)

**"As you know,"** \- **"below you"**

The word **you** is plural here and through verse 13 because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Job 13:2 (#2) (id: 270078)

**""I also know."**

For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the words translated **know** and **falling**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis, for example, by using the intensive pronoun “myself.” Alternate translation: “I myself also know. I myself am not falling”

**""Reproving, he would reprove you"**

Job is speaking as if the **maxims** that his friends have been quoting were literally made of **ashes**. Since, in this culture, garbage was burned into ashes, Job likely means that these **maxims** are worthless, at least as applied to his situation.

**"Why do I take my flesh in my teeth"**

Job is speaking as if he were literally taking (that is, carrying) his own **flesh** in his **teeth**. The image seems to be that of an animal carrying in its mouth prey that it has caught and killed. Until the animal is able to bring the prey safely into its den, the prey is vulnerable and there is a risk that another animal will come and take it.

## Job 13:20 (#2) (id: 270120)

**"do not do"** \- **"from your face"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **do** are singular here because Job is starting to address God directly. He continues to speak to God for the rest of this chapter and in all of chapter 14\.

**""How many iniquities and sins {are} to me?"**

While the terms **iniquities**, **sins**, and **transgression** mean similar things, Job is not necessarily using the three terms together for emphasis. There is a slight distinction between the kinds of activities that these terms describe, and Job may be naming these different activities as specific examples of potential wrongdoing in order to represent all types of wrongdoing. To show this, in your translation you could use three different terms that your language may have for wrongdoing. Alternatively, you could express the general meaning. Either way, you could combine the question and the imperative into a polite request. Alternate translation: “Please tell me what crimes or misdeeds or offenses I may have committed” or “Please tell me if I have done wrong in any way”

Job is speaking as if his courses of action were literally **paths** that he was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you watch everything I do”

## Job 13:27 (#3) (id: 270135)

**"you engrave around the soles of my feet"**

Job is speaking as if God were literally taking some action regarding his **feet**. Interpreters are unsure of the exact meaning of this image. Job could be speaking as if: (1\) God had drawn lines in the ground to mark foot\-shaped areas where Job would have to step. Alternate translation: “you only allow me to step in a few small places” or “you only permit me to do a limited number of things without being punished” (2\) God had put some kind of mark on his feet so that he would leave a distinctive footprint that God could easily track. Alternate translation: “you closely watch all of my actions”

## Job - Chapter 14 Introduction (id: 718643)

Job 14 General Notes
====================

\#\#Structure and Formatting

This chapter is the conclusion of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.

* Verses 1–12: Job says that God should not pay so much attention to humans, since they have short and troubled lives.
* Verses 13–17: Job speculates about what it would be like if God could bring him back to life and be friendly towards him again.
* Verses 18–22: Job concludes pessimistically that he will likely just die and be separated forever from human community.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Resurrection

Job lived at a time when people did not know for certain whether there would be a resurrection of the dead, so Job speculates about this in his speeches. Sometimes he is more hopeful about it, and at other times he is less hopeful about it. In your translation, reflect what he is feeling and saying. It is not necessary to adjust his words in order to make them a confident proclamation about the resurrection.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### singular and plural “you”

The words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation.

### “man” in a generic sense

In several places in this chapter, Job uses the word “man” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, such as “people,” “mortals,” or “humans.”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:1

## Job 14:1 (#1) (id: 270138)

**""Man, born of woman—"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. However, Job is being deliberately terse in order to describe the human condition as pitiful, so you may wish to translate this statement with fewer words than your language would ordinarly use. Alternate translation: “Man, who is born of woman, is few of days and full of trouble”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:1
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: `33267@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:1 (#2) (id: 270139)

**"Man, born of woman"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Every child of a human mother”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:1
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:1 (#3) (id: 270140)

**"Man, born of woman"**

Job is using the phrase **born of woman** by association to mean that people are mortal. In other words, just as they are naturally born, they will naturally die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Mortal man”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:1 (#4) (id: 270141)

**"Man, born of woman"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here and throughout the chapter the masculine term “man” has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, in all such instances you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “Mortal humans”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:1
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: `33276@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:1 (#5) (id: 270142)

**"few of days and full of trouble"**

Job does not mean that in general people live for only a few **days**. He is using the term **days** to mean time in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His life is short and it is full of trouble”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:1
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:1 (#6) (id: 270143)

**"and full of trouble"**

Job is speaking of **Man** as if he were a container that **trouble** fills. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and continually troubled”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:2 (#1) (id: 270144)

**""Like a flower, he comes forth and withers,"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. Since Job is using two different images together, it may be helpful to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is conveying the same idea as the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “He comes forth and withers like a flower; yes, he flees like a shadow and does not stand”

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:2 (#2) (id: 270145)

**"and like a shadow, he flees and does not stand"**

In this context, the word **stand** means to stay in one place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he flees like a shadow; indeed, he does not remain”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:2
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:3 (#1) (id: 270146)

**""Even on such do you open your eye,"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “And yet on such you open your eye! You bring me into judgment with you!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:3
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:3 (#2) (id: 270147)

**"Even on such do you open your eye"**

Job is using the phrase **open your eye** by association to mean watching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Must you really watch such creatures”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:3 (#3) (id: 270148)

**""do you open your eye,"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words **you** and **your** are singular here because Job is continuing to address God directly. So use the singular forms of those pronouns in your translation here and throughout this chapter if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:3
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:4 (#1) (id: 270149)

**""Who will bring clean from unclean?"**

For emphasis, Job is posing a question and then answering it himself. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can bring clean from unclean!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:4
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:4 (#2) (id: 270150)

**""Who will bring clean from unclean?"**

Job is using the adjectives **clean** and **unclean** as nouns, probably to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Every person is unclean, so no person can bear and raise someone who is clean”

See: Nominal Adjectives

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:4
* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:4 (#3) (id: 270151)

**""Who will bring clean from unclean?"**

Job is speaking as if people who are sinful are literally **unclean** or dirty and as if people who are not sinful are literally **clean**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Every person is sinful, so no person can bear and raise someone who is not sinful”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:5 (#1) (id: 270152)

**"his days are determined"**

The pronoun **his** refers to a person in general, as in verse 2\. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a person’s days are determined”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:5
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:5 (#2) (id: 270153)

**"his days are determined"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you have determined his days” or “you determine for how many days each person will live”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:5
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:5 (#3) (id: 270154)

**"the number of his months {is} with you"**

The expression **is with you** describes something that the person being addressed has the power and authority to decide. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “the number of his months is up to you” or “the number of his months is something that you decide”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:6 (#1) (id: 270155)

**"look away from him, that he may desist"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “so that he may desist, look away from him”

See: Connect — Reason\-and\-Result Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:6
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship (ID: `33331@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:6 (#2) (id: 270156)

**"that he may desist"**

In the context of this speech by Job, the word **desist** implicitly means to stop being continually concerned that God is watching and will judge and punish the slightest infraction. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “that he may live without continually fearing your punishment”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:6
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:6 (#3) (id: 270157)

**"until he fulfills his day like a hireling"**

The point of this comparison is that a **hireling**, that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor, has difficult work, but he knows that it is only for a short time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “until he finishes living his difficult but short life”

See: Simile

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:6
* **Associated Articles:** Simile (ID: `33314@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:6 (#4) (id: 270158)

**"he fulfills his day"**

Job is speaking of a human being’s brief life as if it were literally only a **day**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he lives out his brief life”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:7 (#1) (id: 270159)

**""there is hope for a tree if it is cut down,"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way, such as with the verb “hope.” Alternate translation: “people may hope that if a tree is cut down, it will sprout again and it will live”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:7
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:7 (#2) (id: 270160)

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:7
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:8 (#1) (id: 270161)

**"and its stump dies in the ground"**

Job means implicitly that the stump of the tree he is using as an example begins to die. If the tree had died completely, it could not regenerate, as he describes in the next verse. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and its stump begins to die”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:8
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:9 (#1) (id: 270162)

**"from the scent of waters"**

Job is speaking of the tree he is describing as if it could actually smell the **scent** of **waters**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as soon as the ground becomes moist,”

See: Personification

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:9
* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:9 (#2) (id: 270163)

**"and make a branch"**

Job is not referring to a specific **branch**. He actually means that the stump of the tree will send forth many branches or shoots. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and send forth many shoots”

See: Generic Noun Phrases

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:9
* **Associated Articles:** Generic Noun Phrases (ID: `33277@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:9 (#3) (id: 270164)

**"like a plant"**

Job is referring implicitly to a young **plant**, which would grow rapidly. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as young plants do” or “as if it were a young plant”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:10 (#1) (id: 270165)

**"But a man"** \- **"a man"**

In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. These masculine terms have a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “but a mortal … a human being”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:10
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: `33276@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:10 (#2) (id: 270166)

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:11 (#1) (id: 270168)

**""**

This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes at the start of the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 11–12\. Within it, this sentence might say something like this: “Just as waters disappear from a lake and a river dwindles and dries up, so a man lies down and does not arise.”

See: Verse Bridges

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:11
* **Associated Articles:** Verse Bridges (ID: `33410@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:11 (#2) (id: 270169)

**"dwindles and dries up"**

The terms **dwindles** and **dries up** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “steadily dries up”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:11
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:12 (#1) (id: 270170)

**"lies down and does not arise"**

Job is using the expression **lies down** as a mild way to refer to death, and he is using the expression **arise** to mean “come back to life.” Your language may have similar expressions that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “passes away and does not return to this life”

See: Euphemism

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:12
* **Associated Articles:** Euphemism (ID: `33268@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:12 (#2) (id: 270171)

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:12
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:12 (#3) (id: 270172)

**""they will not awake"**

The pronoun **their** and both instances of the pronoun **they** refer to people who die. Up to this point in this speech, Job has been talking about people dying by referring to a “man.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use singular pronouns in this sentence for continuity. Alternate translation: “he will not awake, no, he will not be roused from his sleep”

* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:12 (#4) (id: 270173)

**"and they will not be roused from their sleep"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one will rouse them from their sleep” or “and no one will rouse him from his sleep”

## Job 14:13 (#1) (id: 270174)

**""Who will give {that} you will conceal me in Sheol,"**

See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](https://ref.ly/Job11:5-Job11:6). Alternate translation (as an exclamation): “I wish that you would conceal me in Sheol, {that} you would hide me until the turning of your nose, {that} you would set a limit for me and remember me!”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:13
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:13 (#2) (id: 270175)

**"until the turning of your nose"**

Job is speaking as if God’s **anger** might literally **turn** and go in a different direction. Job actually means that God would stop being angry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “until you stop being angry with me”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:13
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:13 (#3) (id: 270176)

**"that} you will set a limit for me and remember me"**

This could mean implicitly: (1\) that God would set a **limit** on the time that Job had to spend in Sheol before God would **remember** him (see the explanation of the term “remember” in the next note). Alternate translation: “that you would decide how long I needed to spend in Sheol before you would remember me” (2\) that God would choose a particular time sometime in the future when he would **remember** Job. Alternate translation: “that you would choose a particular time when you would remember me”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:13 (#4) (id: 270177)

**"and remember me"**

Job is using the expression **remember** in a particular sense. He is not suggesting that God would forget anything or that there are limits to God’s knowledge or memory. Rather, in contexts such as this, the word “remember” means to be aware that someone needs help and to help that person. (For example, [8:1](https://ref.ly/Gen8:1) says that at the height of the Great Flood, “God remembered Noah and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and help me”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:14 (#1) (id: 270178)

**"If a man dies, will he live"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Even if a man dies, he might live again!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:14 (#2) (id: 270179)

**"All the days of my hardship"**

Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time of my hardship”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:14
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:14 (#3) (id: 270180)

**"All the days of my hardship"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time when things are hard for me”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 14:14
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:14 (#4) (id: 270181)

**"All the days of my hardship"**

Since Job said in [7:1](https://ref.ly/Job7:1) that a person experiences “hardship” on earth, in this phrase he is probably referring implicitly to life on earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “For as long as I live on this earth”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:14 (#5) (id: 270182)

**""I will wait"**

Since Job suggests at the beginning of this verse that people could live again after they die, and since he describes his present life on earth as **hardship**, the implication seems to be that by **my change**, he means his death, which presumably would lead to a better life. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I will wait patiently to die and then live a better life” or “I will hope expectantly that after I die I will live a better life”

## Job 14:15 (#1) (id: 270183)

**""You would call, and I would answer you."**

In this verse, Job is describing what would happen under the condition he described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, to indicate this you could add a connecting word at the start of this verse. You could also use the conditional tense rather than the future tense if that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Then you would call, and I would answer you. You would desire the work of your hands”

See: Connecting Words and Phrases

* **Associated Articles:** Connecting Words and Phrases (ID: `33335@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 14:15 (#2) (id: 270184)

**"You would call, and I would answer you"**

Here Job is using words that are very similar to the ones that he used in [13:22](https://ref.ly/Job13:22) to challenge God to argue his case with him. But now he means that he and God would converse in a friendly way. To help your readers appreciate this use of language, it would be helpful to translate the terms here the same way you translated them in [13:22](https://ref.ly/Job13:22).

## Job 14:15 (#3) (id: 270185)

**"and I would answer you"**

For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I would gladly answer you”

## Job 14:15 (#4) (id: 270186)

## Job 14:16 (#1) (id: 270187)

**""then you would number my steps;"**

Job is speaking as if God literally will **number** or count the **steps** he is taking. He is speaking of living as if it were walking along a path. Job alludes to what he said in [13:27](https://ref.ly/Job13:27), that God was watching his paths and marking places where he had to step. Job could mean here: (1\) that once God was no longer angry with him, God would caringly observe all that he did to ensure that he was all right, but God would no longer be looking to see whether he was doing wrong. Alternate translation: “then you would caringly observe all that I did, but you would no longer be looking to see whether I was doing wrong” (2\) that God is currently restricting his activities, but once God was no longer angry with him, God would not watch him so closely. Alternate translation: “now you are restricting my activities to keep me from doing the slightest thing wrong, but then you would no longer watch me so closely”

## Job 14:17 (#2) (id: 270190)

**"My transgression {would be} sealed in a bag"**

Job is speaking as if God would literally **seal** his **transgression** in a **bag**. He means that God would forgive his transgression and no longer regard it, as if it were hidden from view and inaccessible. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You would completely forgive my transgression”

## Job 14:17 (#3) (id: 270191)

**"and you would plaster over my iniquity"**

Job is speaking as if God would literally **plaster over** his **iniquity**. Once again he means that God would forgive him and no longer regard his iniquity, as if it were hidden from view. Job is using the same terminology as in [13:4](https://ref.ly/Job13:4), where he said that his friends were plastering him with a lie. There he meant that while he was righteous, his friends were making it appear that he was sinful. Here he means that God would make him appear righteous because God would have forgiven all of his sin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you would make me appear righteous”

**""**

This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes in the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 18–19\. It might say something like this: “However, just a falling mountain crumbles and a rock moves from its place, just as waters wear down stones and its flooding washes away the dust of the earth, so you destroy the hope of man”

## Job 14:18 (#2) (id: 270193)

**"However"**

Job is using the word translated **However** to indicate a strong contrast between the possibility of renewed life and reconciliation with God after death, which he was discussing in verses 14–17, and what seems to him to be the actual human condition, which he will describe in the rest of this chapter. In your translation, indicate this strong contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

**"You forever overpower him"**

Job is speaking as if each person were in a lifelong struggle with God and as if God were able to **overpower** or defeat each person throughout his life. Job likely means that people struggle to live, but God is able to enforce his decree that each person must ultimately die after living for a certain time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You make people’s bodies wear out throughout their lives”

Job 15 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Job’s friend Eliphaz speaks to him once again. This time he speaks more strongly than he spoke before.

* Verses 1–10: Eliphaz argues that the insights of traditional wisdom are on his side.
* Verses 11–16: Eliphaz argues that Job should not defiantly insist that he is righteous.
* Verses 17­–19: Eliphaz invites Job to consider the insights of traditional wisdom.
* Verses 20–35: Eliphaz quotes the insights of traditional wisdom.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 15:1

## Job 15:2 (#1) (id: 270205)

**""Will the wise answer {with} knowledge of wind"**

Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the beginning of a question that continues into the next verse, but if you translate it as a statement or as an exclamation, it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “A wise person does not answer with knowledge of wind or fill his belly with the east wind!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 15:2 (#2) (id: 270206)

**""Will the wise answer {with} knowledge of wind"**

Eliphaz is talking about Job in the third person, even though he is speaking to him directly. He is saying that Job himself must not be a wise person, since he has been talking in this way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “I can tell that you are not a wise person, because you have answered with knowledge of wind, yes, you have filled your belly with the east wind!”

## Job 15:2 (#3) (id: 270207)

**"Will the wise answer"**

Eliphaz is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will the wise person answer”

## Job 15:2 (#4) (id: 270208)

**"with} knowledge of wind"**

Eliphaz is speaking as if Job’s **knowledge** consisted literally of **wind**. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. Eliphaz could mean: (1\) that Job is talking a lot, making a loud sound, but not saying anything of substance, just as the wind blows loudly but is only air. Alternate translation: “with such bluster” (2\) that what Job is saying is insubstantial, as if it were the air that the wind was blowing around. Alternate translation: “with such empty statements”

## Job 15:2 (#5) (id: 270209)

**"and fill his belly {with} the east wind"**

Eliphaz is speaking as if Job has literally filled his **belly** with the **east wind**. In this location, the wind from the east brought hot air from the desert. Eliphaz is using this image to portray Job as taking deep breaths so that he can speak at length and then breathing out hot air as he speaks. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No, a wise man would not be so full of hot air”

Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the continuation of a question that began in the previous verse, but it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “No, a wise person does not reason with a word that does not benefit or with words that do not have profit in them!”

Eliphaz is speaking of **Distress** and **anguish** as if they were living things that could **terrify** a wicked person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels distress and anguish”

## Job 15:24 (#2) (id: 270290)

**"Distress and anguish terrify him"**

The terms **Distress** and **anguish** mean similar things. Eliphaz is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Great distress terrifies him” or “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels great distress”

## Job 15:24 (#3) (id: 270291)

**"it overpowers him"**

The pronoun **it** refers to **Distress and anguish**. Eliphaz is speaking of these two similar things as if they were one thing. Your language may permit you to do that in your translation. Alternatively, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “they overpower him”

## Job 15:25 (#1) (id: 270292)

**"he has stretched out his hand against God"**

When Eliphaz says that the wicked person has **stretched out his hand**, he means specifically that he has **stretched out** a **hand** that is holding a sword or some other weapon. In other words, this expression means to fight against someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he has fought against God”

## Job 15:26 (#1) (id: 270293)

**""He rushes against him with the neck,"**

Eliphaz is speaking as if a wicked person would literally attack God in this way. He is actually making a comparison to describe the arrogant confidence with which a wicked person defies God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison rather than as a literal statement. Alternate translation: “He opposes God as if he were a warrior arrogantly attacking God, confident that his thick shield would protect him”

## Job 15:26 (#2) (id: 270294)

**"He rushes against him"**

The pronoun **He** refers to the wicked person, while the pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The wicked person rushes against God”

**"with the neck"**

This expression refers to the attitude of someone who is holding his neck straight and his head high, displaying arrogant confidence with his posture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “arrogantly”

## Job 15:26 (#4) (id: 270296)

**"with the thickness of the bosses of his shields"**

The word “boss” describes the outwardly rounded part of a shield. A warrior would face this part of the shield against an enemy, holding the shield by a handle inside the boss. If a shield had a thick boss, that would protect the warrior against blows from swords and spears, and it would also allow a warrior to use the shield to knock an opponent down and pin him to the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what **bosses** of **shields** are, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “confident that he can use his thick shield to protect himself and attack his opponent”

## Job 15:26 (#5) (id: 270297)

**"with the thickness of"**

Eliphaz speaks in this verse of the \**thickness* of the shield that the wicked person would use against God, but in the next verse he indicates that the wicked person is actually “fat” and so not in shape physically for combat. So while Eliphaz seems to suggest here that the wicked person is a formidable foe, he actually means the opposite of what he is saying, as the next verse reveals. To help your readers recognize this, if your language has a word that can mean both “thick” and “fat,” it would be appropriate to use that word here in your translation.

**"the bosses of his shields"**

By using the plural forms **bosses** and **shields**, Eliphaz seems to be portraying the wicked person as if he were an army or as if he were commanding an army. It may be more natural in your language to use singular forms. Alternate translation: “the boss of his shield”

**""though he has covered his face with his fat"**

Eliphaz is using two parts of the wicked person, his **face** and his **flanks**, to indicate that his whole body is obese. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “though he is very fat”

**""though he has covered his face with his fat"**

The implication is that the wicked person has a **face** that is **fat** and **flanks** that have **blubber** because he overeats and lives indolently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “he is very fat because he eats too much and lives a lazy life”

## Job 15:28 (#1) (id: 270301)

**"And he lives"**

Eliphaz is using the word **And** to describe what happens to the wicked after he unsuccessfully opposes God. In the previous verse, Eliphaz was describing the former prosperity of the wicked person. In this verse, he is describing what happens to the wicked person after he loses his prosperity. The implication may be that the wicked person needs to live in abandoned places not only because he is poor but also because he is an outcast, that is, because others have rejected him. Alternate translation: “Then he becomes poor and outcast, and so”

They will all end in failure, just as a **grapevine** may not be able to nourish its grapes and so they will fall off while they are still **unripe**, and just as an **olive tree** might lose its **blossoms** due to cold weather in the spring and not bear any fruit that year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly.

## Job - Chapter 16 Introduction (id: 718645)

Job 16 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s second speech. In verses 1–6, Job complains that his friends have not helped him with their advice. In verses 7–22, Job describes how he feels God has made him suffer. Job briefly addresses God directly in verses 7 and 8\.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### “witness,” “advocate,” and “intercessor”

In verses 19–21, Job describes the need for someone to plead his case to God in heaven. This is likely the same figure whom Job calls his “redeemer” in [19:25](https://ref.ly/Job19:25). Although Job does not seem to be giving a prophecy knowingly about the Messiah, the role that he describes closely parallels the way that Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. He says that such a person would testify that he had not done wrong (be his “witness”), take his side (be his “advocate”), and plead with God not to punish him (be his “intercessor”). In your translation, use words that describe someone in your culture who does these things for another person. (See: Intercede and Testimony)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

Variation between singular and plural “you”

In verses 1–8, Job sometimes uses the singular form of “you” to address either Eliphaz or God and he sometimes uses the plural form of “you” to address all three of his friends together. Notes identify which form he is using in each instance so that you can use the appropriate form in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you.”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 16:1
* **Associated Articles:** Intercede (ID: `26731@UWTranslationWords`); Testimony (ID: `27151@UWTranslationWords`)

## Job 16:2 (#1) (id: 270323)

**"all of you {are"**

As the context suggests, the word **you** is plural here because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 16:2
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 16:2 (#2) (id: 270324)

**"comforters of trouble"**

Job is not using this possessive form to say that his friends are providing comfort to **trouble**. He is using the form to say that in their attempts to be his **comforters**, they are causing him further trouble. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “troublesome counselors”

## Job 16:3 (#1) (id: 270325)

**""Is there} an end to words of wind?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “I wish that you would stop speaking these words of wind! I do not think anything compels you to answer.”

## Job 16:3 (#3) (id: 270327)

**"you answer"**

The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer only to Eliphaz, who has just spoken to him. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Job 16:4 (#1) (id: 270328)

**"if your souls were where my soul is"**

## Job 16:4 (#4) (id: 270331)

**"and I would shake my head at you"**

To **shake** the **head** at someone is a symbolic action indicating disapproval. This action may have the same meaning in your culture. If not, your culture may have a comparable gesture that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and I would point my finger at you”

## Job 16:5 (#1) (id: 270332)

**""I would strengthen you with my mouth,"**

For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. He does not feel that his friends actually have been strengthening him or relieving him. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “I would say things such as you have been saying, thinking that I was strengthening and comforting you, even though saying such things would actually make you feel worse, as you have been making me feel worse”

## Job 16:7 (#1) (id: 270337)

**"he has exhausted me"**

The pronoun **he** most likely refers to God, since the following pronoun **you** seems clearly to address God. Job seems to be referring to God in the third person in order to make a transition from speaking to his friends, and he then seems to be addressing God directly in the second person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you, God, have exhausted me”

## Job 16:8 (#1) (id: 270339)

**""and you have shriveled me—"**

Job is speaking as if his **shriveled** condition, his **leanness**, were a living thing that was serving as a **witness** and testifying against him. He means that people consider him to be guilty of sin because they believe that God is punishing him with a sickness that has made him lose weight. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and because you have afflicted me with a sickness that has made me emaciated, people consider that to be evidence that I have sinned”

**"sharpens his eyes against me"**

Job is speaking as if God, whom he believes is acting towards him as an **enemy**, were literally sharpening his **eyes**, the way one would sharpen a sword in order to use it dangerously as a weapon. Job means that God is focusing his eyes intently on him to recognize ways to attack him further and to ensure that he, Job, does not escape.

**""but he has shattered me,"**

Job is speaking as if God has literally **shattered** him, breaking him into many parts, and **seized** his neck and **shaken** him **to pieces**. He means that God has destroyed everything important in his life—his family, his health, and his possessions.

He means that it seems as if God has harmed him very intentionally.

**"his archers have surrounded me"**

Job is speaking as if **archers** whom God commands have literally **surrounded** him. He means that God has caused him to experience many different troubles.

**""He pierces my kidneys and he does not spare;"**

Job means implicitly that these archers are seeking mercilessly to kill him by shooting their arrows into his vital organs. (By saying that God **pours** his **bile** on the **ground**, Job means that God’s archers have pierced his liver as well as his **kidneys**, since the liver produces bile and that fluid would spill out of the body if the liver were pierced.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “They are seeking mercilessly to kill me by shooting their arrows into my vital organs”

**""He pierces my kidneys and he does not spare;"**

Job does not mean that arrows have literally pierced his **kidneys** and liver.

**"He breaches me, breach upon the face of breach"**

Job is speaking as if he were a defensive wall around a city and God was smashing openings or breaches in that wall. He means that the continual sufferings that he is experiencing are making him less and less able to be resilient. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

In [15:26](https://ref.ly/Job15:26), Eliphaz used the same image to describe how wicked people oppose God.

## Job 16:15 (#2) (id: 270361)

**"and I have thrust my horn into the dust"**

People in the biblical culture used the **horn** of an animal to represent strength and honor. When they did, they would speak of humans as if they had horns like animals. For example, [112:9](https://ref.ly/Ps112:9) says of the person who fears Yahweh, “His horn rises high in honor.” Job is using the image in the opposite way to say that he is suffering disgrace.

It is likely that Job is continuing to address the **Earth** in this part of the verse. Once again he is doing that in order to show in a strong way how he feels about what has been happening to him. Job is speaking as if the earth could hear him and as if it could make sure that none of its locations would provide a **place** for anyone to hide Job’s **cry** so that it was not answered. The context makes clear that this is a cry for justice.

**""my witness {is} in the heavens,"**

See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter to decide how to translate the terms **witness** and **advocate**, which both describe the same person, someone whom Job expects will intercede for him in heaven.

## Job 16:19 (#2) (id: 270369)

**"is} in the heights"**

Job is using the term **heights** to mean heaven, which is high above the earth. The plural form probably identifies these **heights** as the supreme example of their class. That is, while being on top of a mountain gives someone a commanding position, ruling from heaven gives God the supremely commanding position. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is in highest heaven” or “is in heaven, where he rules supremely”

## Job 16:20 (#1) (id: 270370)

**"My intercessors {are} my friends"**

This could mean: (1\) that Job has a single individual in mind here, the one he called his “witness” and “advocate” in the previous verse. While the terms **intercessors** and **friends** are plural, it seems Job could be using plural forms to indicate an indefinite individual. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “There is a certain intercessor who is my friend” (2\) that Job is saying that by contrast with the way this “witness” and “advocate” will take his side, his friends have been scoffing at him. The word translated **intercessors** can also mean “scoffers” (although Job uses it again in [33:23](https://ref.ly/Job33:23) to mean “intercessor”).

**"Please set down, be surety for me with you"**

Job is similarly speaking as if God would literally **be surety** for him, that is, personally guarantee his appearance and conduct. Job speaks this way even though he says at the same time that God himself would be trying his case (that is the meaning of **with you**).

**"If {our} rest {will be} together in the dust"**

## Job - Chapter 18 Introduction (id: 718647)

Job 18 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad speaks to him for a second time. As Eliphaz did in his second speech to Job in chapter 15, Bildad speaks more strongly to Job in this speech than he did in his first speech. Using much of the same language that Job used in chapters 16 and 17, Bildad defends himself and the other two friends and warns Job that God will punish him severely if he continues to be wicked (as Bildad believes him to be).

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

## Job 18:2 (#1) (id: 270442)

**"Until when will you make ends of words"**

Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should make an end of words right now!” or “It is not helpful for you to keep saying such things!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:2 (#2) (id: 270443)

**"Until when will you make ends of words"**

Bildad is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Bildad is answering Job by using the same language that Job used in [16:3](https://ref.ly/Job16:3). See how you translated the expression “an end to words” there; **ends of words** here is a slight variation. Alternate translation: “For how long will you keep talking”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:2 (#3) (id: 270444)

**"will you make"** \- **"Consider"**

The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative **Consider** are plural. Bildad may be using these plural forms because he is answering Job in his own words and Job addressed “all of you” (meaning his three friends) when he asked in 16:3](../16/03\.md), “Is there an end to words of wind?” Bildad could be portraying Job as representative of a group of people who think and speak as he does. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” it may be more natural to use singular forms in your translation.

* **Associated Articles:** Unusual Uses of the Plural (ID: `33395@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:3 (#1) (id: 270445)

**""Why are we regarded as beasts,"**

Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “We should not be regarded as beasts, stupid in your eyes!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:3
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:3 (#2) (id: 270446)

**"Why are we regarded as beasts"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Why do you regard us as beasts”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:3
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:3 (#3) (id: 270447)

**"as beasts"**

Bildad is using this comparison to say that just as **beasts** have no understanding, so Job regards his friends as having no understanding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “as beasts that have no understanding”

See: Simile

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:3
* **Associated Articles:** Simile (ID: `33314@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:3 (#4) (id: 270448)

**"in your eyes"**

Bildad is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from your perspective”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:3 (#5) (id: 270449)

**"in your eyes"**

The word **your** is plural here, like the word “you” in the previous verse. Since Bildad is addressing Job, it may be more natural to use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

* **Associated Articles:** Unusual Uses of the Plural (ID: `33395@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:4 (#1) (id: 270450)

**"The one tearing himself in his nose"**

Bildad is speaking about Job in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “You who tear yourself in your nose”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:4
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:4 (#2) (id: 270451)

**"The one tearing himself in his nose"**

Bildad is continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [16:9](https://ref.ly/Job16:9), Job spoke as if God were literally a wild animal that had **torn** him in his anger. Bildad is saying that it is actually Job who is tearing himself apart in his own anger. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is you who are tearing yourself apart in your anger”

## Job 18:4 (#3) (id: 270452)

**""will the earth be forsaken for your sake,"**

Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The earth will not be forsaken for your sake, and the rock will not move from its place!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:4
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:4 (#4) (id: 270453)

**"will the earth be forsaken"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “will people forsake the earth” or “will people stop living on the earth”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:4
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:4 (#5) (id: 270454)

**"or will the rock move from its place"**

Bildad is continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [14:18–19](https://ref.ly/Job14:18-Job14:19), Job said to God, “you destroy the hope of man,” and he compared that to the way “a rock moves from its place.” This could be a reference to an earthquake or a landslide. Bildad is implying that Job is being overly grandiose by comparing his individual situation with great natural events. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It is not as if your individual situation is a great earthquake!”

## Job 18:5 (#1) (id: 270455)

**""the light of the wicked goes out;"**

Bildad is speaking of the happiness and prosperity of a wicked person as if those things were literally a **light** or **flame**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “any happiness or prosperity that wicked people enjoy will not last for very long”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:5 (#2) (id: 270456)

**"the wicked"**

Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people” or, since Bildad uses the singular **his** later in the verse, “a wicked person”

See: Nominal Adjectives

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:5
* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:6 (#1) (id: 270457)

**""The light in his tent will be dark,"**

Bildad is continuing to speak of the happiness and prosperity of a wicked person as if those things were literally a **light** or **lamp**. He is also continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [17:12](https://ref.ly/Job17:12), Job said that his friends were telling him that light must be near because it was presently so dark in his life. Bildad is saying here in response that wicked people may be in the light, but soon it will become dark for them. To help make this clear to your readers, it may be helpful to use the same language here that you used in [17:12](https://ref.ly/Job17:12). Alternate translation: “Even though a wicked person may have light, darkness is near” or “Even though a wicked person may experience prosperity, soon he will have trouble instead”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:7 (#1) (id: 270458)

**"The steps of his strength will shorten"**

Bildad is using one sign of weakness, a shortening stride, to indicate weakness in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will become weak”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:7
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:7 (#2) (id: 270459)

**"The steps of his strength"**

Bildad is using this possessive form to speak of **steps** that are characterized by **strength**. It may be more natural for you to express this meaning using a form other than a possessive. Alternate translation: “His vigorous stride”

See: Possession

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:7
* **Associated Articles:** Possession (ID: `33303@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:7 (#3) (id: 270460)

**"and his plan will cast him down"**

Bildad is speaking of a **plan** that a wicked person might make as if it were a living thing that could **cast him down**, that is, throw him or make him fall onto the ground. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his schemes will only harm him in the end”

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:8 (#1) (id: 270461)

**""he will be cast into a net by his feet,"**

Bildad is speaking as if a wicked person would literally be caught in a **net** or **pitfall**. He means that such a person will experience troubles that will keep him from fulfilling his plans. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will experience troubles that will keep him from fulfilling his plans”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:8
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:8 (#2) (id: 270462)

**"he will be cast into a net by his feet"**

Bildad is speaking of the **feet** of a wicked person as if they were a living thing that could **cast** him **into a net**. The implication seems to be that if the feet of the wicked person, rather than his eyes and his mind, are determining where he is going, he will walk into dangers unawares. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will walk unawares into a net”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:8
* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:8 (#3) (id: 270463)

**"a pitfall"**

A **pitfall** is a type of trap for animals. To make it, people dig a pit in the ground and cover it with netting. They then put plant materials all over the netting to make it appear that the ground above the pit is just ordinary ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what a pitfall is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a concealed trap”

## Job 18:9 (#1) (id: 270464)

**""A snare will seize {him} by the heel;"**

Bildad is continuing to speak of a wicked person as if he would literally be caught in a **snare** or **trap**. If you decided in the previous verse to express the meaning of this image rather than retain it in your translation, you could restate the meaning here. Alternate translation: “Yes, a wicked person will not be able to succeed; he will fail because of all the trouble that he causes for himself”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:9
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:9 (#2) (id: 270465)

**"A snare will seize {him} by the heel"**

A **snare** was a device that people in this culture used to catch birds. It consisted of a loose loop of cord. A hunter would put seeds or other bait inside the loop. When a bird came inside the loop to eat the bait, the hunter would pull on the cord and catch the bird by its feet. A snare might also have a mechanism that a bird would trigger automatically by stepping inside the loop. Bildad is speaking as if this would happen to a wicked person, so that he would be caught **by the heel**. If your readers would not be familiar with what a snare is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “He will step into a device that will seize his foot”

* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: `33408@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:9 (#3) (id: 270466)

**"a trap"**

By **trap**, Bildad means some other device for catching birds or animals. Interpreters are unsure exactly what this device is. The word Bildad uses suggests the idea of braiding, and so this could be a net of some kind. Alternate translation: “a net”

## Job 18:10 (#1) (id: 270467)

**""His rope is hidden in the ground,"**

Bildad is continuing to speak of a wicked person as if he would literally be caught by a **rope** or **trap**. If you decided in the previous two verses to express the meaning of this image rather than retain it in your translation, you could restate the meaning in another way here.

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 18:10
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:10 (#2) (id: 270468)

**"His rope"** \- **"and his trap for him"**

In these possessive forms, **His** and **his** are the objects rather than the subjects of **rope** and **trap**. That is, Bildad is not speaking of a rope and trap that the wicked person owns but of a rope and trap that will catch the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The rope that will catch him … and the trap that will catch him is hidden”

**"His rope is hidden in the ground"**

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:10 (#4) (id: 270470)

**"His rope"**

By **rope**, Bildad means some further device for catching birds or animals. He seems to mean some larger device for catching animals that would work the same way as a “snare” that catches birds. A hunter might hide a loop of rope **in the ground** and pull on the rope to catch an animal once it stepped inside the loop. Alternate translation: “a loop of rope to catch him”

* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: `33408@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:10 (#5) (id: 270471)

**"and his trap for him {on} the path"**

Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and a trap is hidden for him on the path”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: `33267@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:10 (#6) (id: 270472)

**"and his trap"**

It is unclear whether Bildad is talking about a specific type of **trap** here. He may be using a general term for any device that would catch a bird or animal. If your language has such a general term, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation.

## Job 18:11 (#1) (id: 270473)

**"and they will chase him at his feet"**

Bildad is speaking of these **Terrors** as if they were a living thing that could **chase** a wicked person the way a dog or wolf would, nipping at his **feet** to disable him so that he could not run away to safety. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will not be able to escape from these troubles”

## Job 18:12 (#1) (id: 270474)

**"His strength becomes hungry"**

Bildad is speaking of the **strength** of a wicked person as if it were a living thing that could become **hungry**. He means that a wicked person’s strength becomes weakened as if by hunger. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is weakened as if by hunger”

**"and disaster {is} prepared"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “and God has prepared disaster”

## Job 18:12 (#3) (id: 270476)

**"at his side"**

Bildad is speaking as if **disaster** were literally at the **side** of a wicked person. He means that it will strike him as soon as there is opportunity. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to strike him as soon as there is opportunity”

## Job 18:13 (#1) (id: 270477)

**""It devours parts of his skin;"**

The pronoun **It** refers to **the firstborn of death** later in the verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put the noun phrase in the first part of the verse and the pronoun in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “The firstborn of death devours parts of his skin; it devours his parts”

## Job 18:13 (#2) (id: 270478)

**"the firstborn of death"**

The expression **the firstborn of death** means the strongest kind of death or a terrible kind of death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a deadly disease”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:13 (#3) (id: 270479)

**"his parts"**

Since the pronoun **his** in this possessive form refers to the wicked person as a whole, it is likely that the word **parts** describes his arms and his legs. Alternate translation: “his arms and his legs”

## Job 18:14 (#1) (id: 270480)

**"He is pulled"** \- **"and one marches him"**

If terror is indeed the agent that Bildad says pulls the wicked person from his tent, then Bildad is speaking of terror as if it were a living thing that could do this. He actually means that the disasters that cause a wicked person to feel terror also deprive him of safety and security. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The disasters that cause him to feel terror take him away … and they march him”

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 18:14 (#2) (id: 270481)

**"He is pulled"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, from the context it appears that this may be terror itself, since terror seems to be personified in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “Terror pulls him”

## Job 18:14 (#3) (id: 270482)

**"and one marches him to the king of terrors"**

The pronoun **one** probably refers to terror. The pronoun is feminine, as is the word “terror,” and Hebrew speakers sometimes used feminine pronouns to represent feminine subjects they had not yet named but which they had in mind. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and terror marches him to its king”

## Job 18:14 (#4) (id: 270483)

**"and one marches him to the king of terrors"**

If the pronoun **one** does refer to terror, then Bildad is speaking of terror as if it were a living thing, a soldier, who could march a captured enemy to his **king** as a prisoner. Once again Bildad would be using terror to mean the disasters that cause a wicked person to feel terror. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the disasters that cause him to feel terror bring him to the king of terrors”

## Job 18:14 (#5) (id: 270484)

**"and one marches him to the king of terrors"**

Like the expression “the firstborn of death” in the previous verse, the expression **the king of terrors** here is a superlative. It means the worst terror there is, specifically, death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the disasters that cause him to feel terror ultimately cause him to die”

## Job 18:15 (#1) (id: 270485)

**"One will dwell in his tent"**

The pronoun **One** is feminine in this verse, as in the previous verse, and so it may refer once again to terror. (However, interpreters have a range of understandings of what this verse means.) Alternate translation: “Terror will dwell in his tent”

## Job 18:15 (#2) (id: 270486)

**"which is} not to him"**

Bildad means implicitly that the **tent** will no longer belong to the wicked person, probably because he will be dead (a prisoner of the “king of terrors,” death, as the previous verse describes). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “which will be abandoned because he is dead”

**"sulfur is scattered upon his home"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

## Job - Chapter 19 Introduction (id: 718648)

Job 19 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s second speech. It is structured as a chiasm. (See the discussion of that poetic form in the General Introduction to Job.)

* Verses 1–7: Job rebukes his friends for not being sympathetic to him.
* Verses 8–1: Job uses images to describe how God has made him suffer.
* Verses 13–19: Job describes how his family and friends have abandoned him.
* Verses 20–21: Job uses images to describe how God has made him suffer.
* Verse 22: Job rebukes his friends for not being sympathetic to him.
* Verses 23–24: Job wishes that people would hear his defense and he foresees that God will vindicate him.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Job’s Faith

In verses 25–27, Job shows the great depth of his faith in God even after suffering so much. Job believes that even if God is treating him unfairly now, God will ultimately do the right thing. Job does not understand that God is actually not treating him unfairly. But the faith and confidence that he nevertheless has in God are remarkable. (See: Faith)

* **Associated Articles:** Faith (ID: `26583@UWTranslationWords`)

## Job 19:2 (#1) (id: 270503)

**""Until when will you afflict my soul"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have afflicted my soul and crushed me with words for long enough!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 19:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 19:2 (#2) (id: 270504)

**"will you afflict"** \- **"and crush me"**

The word **you** is plural here and through verse 5 because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 19:2
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 19:2 (#3) (id: 270505)

The expression **ten times** means “many times,” not literally ten times, no more and no less. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “many times”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 19:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 19:3 (#2) (id: 270509)

## Job 19:4 (#1) (id: 270510)

**"my error remains with me"**

Interpreters are not certain what Job means by this statement. He could mean: (1\) that any sin he might have committed would be his own private concern. This would be consistent with his rebuke of his friends for reproaching him publicly as a sinner. Alternate translation: “that would be my own private concern” (2\) that he would be the only one who would know for sure whether he had sinned. Alternate translation: “that would be for me to determine”

## Job 19:6 (#1) (id: 270512)

**"and his net has closed around me"**

Job is speaking as if a **net** that God had set as a trap had literally **closed around** him. Job is answering Bildad in his own words, but Job is making the net a symbol of the unjust punishment of the innocent rather than of the just punishment of the wicked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he has unfairly punished me even though I am innocent”

## Job 19:19 (#1) (id: 270541)

**"the friends of my counsel"**

Job is using this possessive form to describe the **friends** with whom he took **counsel**, that is, the friends with whom he shared his private thoughts and whose advice he asked. Alternate translation: “the friends in whom I confided”

## Job 19:20 (#1) (id: 270543)

**"My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh"**

Job is not referring to a specific **bone**. He means all of his bones. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh”

## Job 19:20 (#2) (id: 270544)

**"My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh"**

Job is speaking of this representative **bone** as if it were living thing that could **cling** to his **skin** and **flesh**. He means that his bones are right next to his skin and flesh, that is, all of the muscle in between has wasted away. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am just skin and bones”

## Job 19:20 (#3) (id: 270545)

**"and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth"**

Job is speaking as if he had barely **escaped** from some disaster, and he is describing what he was able to escape with. Interpreters have different ideas about what he is describing, but they generally agree that it means something insignificant. Alternate translation: “and there is practically nothing left of me”

## Job 19:21 (#1) (id: 270546)

**"Pity me, pity me"**

Job is repeating the verb **Pity** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Please have pity on me”

**""Why do you pursue me as God {would}?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You should not pursue me as God would! You should be satisfied with my flesh!”

**"Why do you pursue me as God {would"**

The point of this comparison is that just as God would **pursue** someone relentlessly to make sure that sin was punished appropriately, so Job’s friends have been relentlessly insisting that he has sinned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Why do you insist relentlessly that I have sinned” or, as a statement, “You should not insist relentlessly that I have sinned”

**"And will you not be satisfied with my flesh"**

Job is likely alluding to a popular expression. In this culture, if someone accused another person maliciously, people said that he was “eating the pieces” of that person. Job is suggesting that his friends are ”eating“ him in this sense (that is, accusing him maliciously) and they are not yet **satisfied** with the amount of his **flesh** that they have ”eaten.“ If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And will you never stop accusing me maliciously” or, as a statement, “Yes, you should stop accusing me so maliciously”

In context, Job is suggesting that this is actually unlikely, even though he wishes that it could happen. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

## Job 19:24 (#1) (id: 270557)

**"With a stylus of iron"**

A **stylus** was an iron tool that people in this culture used to engrave writing onto hard surfaces. They would strike the stylus with another tool such as a hammer in order to remove tiny pieces of the surface a little at a time in order to create letters. For better visibility, they would sometimes then fill these letters with lead, which is a soft metal that they could pound into shape. If your readers would not be familiar with what a stylus is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “With a small iron tool cutting tool”

## Job 19:25 (#1) (id: 270558)

**"But I know {that"**

Job is using the word translated **But** to draw a contrast between what he has just suggested is unlikely, that his claims of innocence will be recorded for posterity, and something that he is very confident about, that his **redeemer** will ultimately vindicate him as innocent. In your translation, you may wish to introduce this verse in a way that will indicate this contrast more explicitly.

**"But I know {that"**

For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **know**.

**"my redeemer lives"**

Job means implicitly that even though he expects to die, his **redeemer** will still be alive to vindicate him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “even though I expect to die soon, my redeemer will still be alive”

## Job 19:25 (#4) (id: 270561)

**"my redeemer"**

A **redeemer** was a close relative who would take responsibility to do whatever was necessary to help another family member who was threatened or in need. Your language and culture may have a name for a person who fulfills this role, and you could use that name in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the close relative who will vindicate me”

* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: `33408@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 19:25 (#5) (id: 270562)

**"my redeemer"**

As Job indicates in the next verse, he believes that God will be his **redeemer**. This is similar to the way that Job speaks in [16:19](https://ref.ly/Job16:19) of having an “advocate” in heaven and to the way that he asks God in [17:3](https://ref.ly/Job17:3) to be his “surety.” Since Job speaks of God in the next verse, you do not need to explain in this verse that God is the **redeemer** whom Job is expecting. It may even be that Job wishes to generate some suspense and attention by not naming the redeemer right away, and it would be good to give your readers that same experience.

**"he will stand"**

In this culture, people stood up when they were about to speak. This was a symbolic action by which they indicated that they had something important to say. Standing up commanded the attention of the people they wanted to listen to them. In this context, the important thing that the redeemer had to say would be that Job was innocent. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “he will stand and speak in my defense”

## Job 19:25 (#8) (id: 270565)

**"upon the dust"**

Job is using the term **dust** by association to mean the earth, on whose surface there is dust. This may also be a poetic allusion to the fact that Job would be dead and at “rest” in the “dust,” as he said in [17:16](https://ref.ly/Job17:16).

**"and {that} after my skin, they strike this off"**

The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context.

**"and {that} after my skin, they strike this off"**

Job is speaking as if someone or something might literally **strike** the **skin** off his bones. He could mean: (1\) that his body will decay so that only the bones are left. Alternate translation: “and that even after my body decays so that only the bones are left” (2\) that worms, such as he mentioned in [17:14](https://ref.ly/Job17:14), will eat the skin off his bones.

This would be an implicit expression of faith and confidence in the resurrection of the body. Alternate translation: “yet from my resurrected body” (2\) apart from his flesh, that is, as a spirit after death. Alternate translation: “yet as a spirit after death”

## Job 19:26 (#4) (id: 270569)

**"I will behold God"**

As the General Notes to chapter 13 discuss, in this culture, a subject would be able to look a sovereign in the face if the sovereign favored that subject. Job seems to be alluding here to that cultural norm. The implication is that God will no longer consider him guilty but acknowledge that he was innocent all along. Job indicates in the previous verse that God will also acknowledge his innocence publicly to everyone on earth. Alternate translation: “I will be able to look God in the face because he will affirm that I am innocent”

**"and not a stranger"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. In this context, the word **stranger** means “someone else.” But it is also an allusion to what Job said in verse 15, that people who knew him now regard him as a “stranger.” Alternate translation: “and it will not be someone else who beholds him”

## Job - Chapter 20 Introduction (id: 718649)

Job 20 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the second speech of Job’s friend Zophar. In this chapter, Zophar speaks more strongly to Job than he did the first time spoke to him.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Zophar answering Job with his own words

In [7:8](https://ref.ly/Job7:8), as Job was appealing to God, he said, “The eye of the one seeing me will not regard me; your eyes will be on me, but I will not exist.” Zophar says in [20:9](https://ref.ly/Job20:9) about the wicked person, “The eye that saw him will not continue.” Job said in [7:10](https://ref.ly/Job7:10) of himself as a mortal person, “He will not return again to his house, and his place will not know him again.” Zophar says of the wicked person in [20:9](https://ref.ly/Job20:9), “his place will no longer observe him.” In both instances Zophar is suggesting that Job himself is a wicked person, using Job’s own words.

Similarly, Zophar says in [20:27](https://ref.ly/Job20:27) of the wicked person that “the heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will raise itself up against him” as a witness. In [16:18](https://ref.ly/Job16:18), Job called upon the earth to see that he received justice, and in [16:19](https://ref.ly/Job16:19), Job said that he had an advocate in the heavens. So Zophar is likely answering Job once again in his own words, implying that Job himself is a wicked person of the type that he has been describing in his speech.

To help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate what Zophar says in these instances similarly to the way you translated what Job said earlier.

### Indelicate images that Zophar uses

As noted above, Zophar speaks strongly to Job in this speech. He uses a couple of images drawn from bodily functions that people in your culture might consider indelicate to include in a Bible translation. If so, you could use comparable images. Zophar says in [20:7](https://ref.ly/Job20:7) of the wicked person, “he will perish forever like his dung.” You could refer to something else that disappears completely, saying, for example, “he will perish forever like the dust that the wind blows away.” Zophar says of the wicked person in [20:15](https://ref.ly/Job20:15), “He swallows wealth, but he will vomit it.” You might say instead something such as, “Though he may become rich, he will lose all his money.”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 20:1

## Job 20:2 (#1) (id: 270583)

**"Therefore"**

Zophar is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the reason he is about to give for why he is speaking to Job again. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “This is why”

* **Associated Articles:** Connecting Words and Phrases (ID: `33335@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 20:2 (#2) (id: 270584)

**"my thoughts turn me back"**

Zophar is speaking of his **thoughts** as if they were a living thing that could **turn** him **back**, that is, make him turn around and return to Job as if he had left him. He means that he wants to speak to Job again and share what he is thinking in response to what Job has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I need to speak to you again and tell you what I am thinking”

**"a rebuke of dishonor to me"**

Zophar is using this possessive form to describe a **rebuke** that he feels has brought **dishonor** to him. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a rebuke that dishonors me”

**"but a spirit from my understanding answers me"**

## Job 20:23 (#1) (id: 270643)

**""He will be {about} to fill his belly, he will send the burning of his nose against him,"**

The pronoun **He** at the start of this verse, the two instances of **him**, and the second instance of **his** refer to the wicked person, while the two instances of **he** later in the verse and the first instance of **his** refer to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The wicked person will be about to fill his belly, and God will send the burning of his nose against that wicked person, yes, God will rain it upon that person while that person is eating”

In this culture, in order to begin a case against someone, a person would stand up among those who had gathered in the public square. Someone who had evidence to bring in such a proceeding would similarly stand up. Either way, the earth, Zophar says, would testify that the wicked person was guilty.

## Job - Chapter 21 Introduction (id: 718650)

Job 21 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is Job’s response to Zophar’s second speech.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Punishment for the sins of one’s parents or ancestors

In the culture in which the book of Job was composed, people commonly believed that God might punish someone for the sins of their parents or ancestors. Job says in verse 19 of this chapter that this is what his three friends believe. However, while people’s sins may have consequences for their children and descendants, God does not punish people directly for their parents’ or ancestors’ sins. Be sure that this is clear in your translation.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### The adjective “wicked” as a noun

In verses 7, 16, 17, and 28, Job uses the adjective “wicked” as a noun to mean wicked people in general. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase such as “wicked people.”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 21:1

## Job 21:2 (#1) (id: 270671)

**"Hearing,"** \- **"your consolation"**

The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **hear** are plural because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 21:2
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:2 (#2) (id: 270672)

**"Hearing, hear my words"**

Job is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully to my words”

See: Reduplication

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 21:2
* **Associated Articles:** Reduplication (ID: `33308@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:2 (#3) (id: 270673)

**"my words"**

Job is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I am about to say”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 21:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:2 (#4) (id: 270674)

**"your consolation"**

Job is using this possessive form to describe not the **consolation** that his friends will have but the **consolation** that he wants them to offer him. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the consolation that you offer to me”

See: Possession

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 21:2
* **Associated Articles:** Possession (ID: `33303@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:3 (#1) (id: 270675)

**"Tolerate me"** \- **"you may mock"**

The implied “you” in the imperative **Tolerate** is plural because Job is addressing his three friends, but the pronoun **you** later in the verse is singular because Job is responding directly to Zophar. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you.”

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 21:3
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:3 (#2) (id: 270676)

**"and I will speak"**

For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **speak**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I will take my turn and speak”

* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:3 (#3) (id: 270677)

**"you may mock"**

For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “you will probably continue to mock me, even though you should not do so”

## Job 21:4 (#1) (id: 270678)

**"is} my complaint to a man"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “my complaint is not to a man!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:4 (#2) (id: 270679)

**"is} my complaint to a man"**

* **Associated Articles:** Double Negatives (ID: `33265@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 21:4 (#4) (id: 270681)

**"And if"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. (Some languages may be able to say simply “And if not” to follow up on a question that expects a negative answer.) Alternate translation: “And if my complaint is not to a mortal but to God”

## Job 21:5 (#1) (id: 270684)

**"Look"** \- **"and lay"**

## Job 21:5 (#2) (id: 270685)

**"and lay the hand upon the mouth"**

## Job 21:5 (#3) (id: 270686)

**"and lay the hand upon the mouth"**

Covering the **mouth** with the **hand** prevents a person from speaking. Job is suggesting that his three friends perform this symbolic action to indicate that his situation is so tragic and distressing that nothing can be said about it.

**""Behold, their prosperity {is} not in their hand!"**

Job is making two statements in this verse that express strong feelings. In the previous verse, he described how wicked people say that they do not need to pray to God because that would not benefit them. In his first statement here, he insists in response that any benefit or **prosperity** that the wicked enjoy is something that God has generously given to them even though they do not deserve it. In his second statement, Job reacts strongly against the **counsel** or advice that he said wicked people give themselves, that they should not serve the Almighty or pray to him. The ULT places exclamation marks at the end of these sentences to show that they communicate strong emotion. In your translation, use your own language’s way of showing that.

**"His pails are full of milk"**

Interpreters are not entirely sure of the meaning of the word translated as **pails**. One likely interpretation is that it describes pails that people would use to collect milk from their cattle. If that is the meaning, then Job is using one aspect of this person’s prosperity, the fact that his cattle give milk abundantly, to indicate that the person is prosperous in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His cattle give milk abundantly” or “He is very prosperous”

Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase.

**"Or"** \- **"their signs"**

Job is using the word **signs** in a specific sense. He means proofs or tokens that something is true. He is probably referring to stories that travelers tell of wicked people whom they have seen or heard about. These stories, in Job’s opinion, would offer evidence that he is right and his friends are wrong about what happens to wicked people. (Job describes the content of these stories in the next verse.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or … the truth of the stories they tell about wicked people”

## Job - Chapter 22 Introduction (id: 718651)

Job 22 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the third and last speech of Job’s friend Eliphaz. What he says in this speech is stronger than what he says in his previous two speeches. He insists that Job must have done wrong, and he suggests several specific evil things that Job may have done.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Eliphaz answering Job with his own words

In several places in this chapter, Eliphaz answers Job with his own words. That is, Eliphaz uses the same expressions that Job did earlier, but with different meaning and implications. To help your readers appreciate this, you may wish to translate Eliphaz’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.

**"For"**

Eliphaz is not saying that Job has definitely done the wrongs that he describes in this verse and the next three verses.

## Job 22:6 (#2) (id: 270808)

**"you have bound your brother {with a pledge} without cause"**

By **without cause**, Eliphaz probably means that Job did not need to take a garment in pledge as security for the kind of small loan that a laborer in this culture would require. Job was a wealthy man, Eliphaz notes in verse 8, and he could afford a relatively small loss, while the outer garment the laborer would have to give in pledge (described in the second half of the verse) probably represented his most valuable possession. Eliphaz may also be suggesting that the laborer was trustworthy and Job could have and should have trusted him to repay the loan without demanding security. Your culture may have terms and customs relating to loans and pledges that you could use in your translation to bring out the implicit meaning here. Alternate translation: “you have forced your brother to give you his outer garment as security for a loan, even though you did not need to do that”

**"your brother"**

## Job 22:6 (#4) (id: 270810)

**"and you have stripped off the clothing of the naked"**

The word translated **naked** can describe people who have little clothing, and that seems to be the meaning here. It would not make sense to speak of the **clothing** of people who were **naked** in the sense of having no clothing. The idea seems to be that by taking in pledge an outer garment that a laborer would also use as a blanket at night, Job was leaving that person without enough clothing to stay warm. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “indeed, you have left that person without enough clothing to stay warm”

**""but the man of arm, the earth {was} to him,"**

Eliphaz could mean: (1\) that Job himself was this **man of arm**. In that case he would be speaking of Job in the third person, even though he was speaking directly to Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “even though, as a man of arm, the earth was to you, and you dwelt upon it as someone lifted of face” (2\) that Job showed favoritism to powerful and honored people.

He means that Job has not helped orphans but has treated them in a way that has made them even weaker and more destitute. (As in the previous verse, the arm is a symbol of power.)

Eliphaz is using the adjectives **righteous** and **innocent** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Righteous people … and innocent people”

## Job 22:20 (#1) (id: 270855)

**""If our enemy is not cut off?"**

The pronoun **their** refers to the **enemy** mentioned in the first part of the verse. It may be more natural in your language to make the pronoun agree in number. Since Eliphaz speaks of wicked people in the plural in these verses, you may find it appropriate to do that by saying “enemies.” Alternate translation: “If our enemies are not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions”

**"If our enemy is not cut off"**

**"If our enemy is not cut off"**

To make a different point, that God actually judges wicked people in this life, Eliphaz is echoing what Job said in [21:21](https://ref.ly/Job21:21). There Job spoke of a wicked person dying as if he were literally being **cut off**, like a branch from a tree. See how you translated the similar expression there.

## Job 22:21 (#1) (id: 270863)

**"Reconcile now with him and be at peace"**

Eliphaz is echoing his own words at the beginning of this speech and Job’s words in his preceding speech. In verse 2, Eliphaz insisted that a person cannot be “useful to God,” that is, a person can do nothing to win God’s favor or to put God under obligation. Here Eliphaz uses a different form of the same verb to encourage Job to **Reconcile** with God. A person, he says, can at least cultivate a good relationship with God. Job said in [21:19](https://ref.ly/Job21:19) that he wished God would “repay” wicked people, that is, punish them. Eliphaz uses the same verb here to encourage Job to be **at peace** with God, with the suggestion that to that end, Job should do whatever is necessary to make up for any wrong things he has done. Your language may have terms that you could use here and in [21:19](https://ref.ly/Job21:19) and [22:2](https://ref.ly/Job22:2) in order to show these connections.

## Job - Chapter 23 Introduction (id: 718652)

Job 23 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response continues in the next chapter.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Legal proceeding

In this chapter, Job speaks of making a legal case to prove his innocence to God. As a note to [9:3](https://ref.ly/Job9:3) explains, in this culture, people typically presented such cases to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party in a dispute would question the other party in the presence of the leaders, and the leaders would then discuss the case and decide which party was guilty and which party was innocent. However, the Bible indicates that judges would also travel around from place to place and hear cases. For example, [1 Samuel 7:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:16-1Sam7:17) says that Samuel “went around to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all those places.” Job is envisioning God serving as this kind of judge and hearing his case. In your translation, express his language in such a way that readers who are familiar with the legal process in your own culture will recognize what Job is saying.

Translation issues in This chapter
----------------------------------

### “he,” “him,” and “his”

The pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to God throughout this chapter. The UST models how a translation may say “God” regularly in order to make this clear.

### “my hand” or “his hand” (23:2\)

In verse 2, Hebrew manuscripts read “my hand.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible into other languages say “his hand,” and some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the readingof the ULT.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 23:1

## Job 23:2 (#1) (id: 270903)

## Job - Chapter 24 Introduction (id: 718653)

Job 24 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the continuation of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response began in the previous chapter.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### God’s judgment of wicked people

In verses 1–17, Job protests that God does not judge wicked people. He lists many oppressive things that wicked people do to vulnerable, innocent people, and he complains that God acts as if there were nothing wrong with those things. But in verses 18–24, Job then describes how God actually does judge wicked people. There is an explanation for this apparent contradiction. In the speech as a whole, Job is saying that he knows God will judge wicked people in the end, but it is very distressing to him that God does not judge and punish them now in order to keep them from continuing to oppress vulnerable people. In your translation, you can use language that shows that Job firmly believes what he says in both parts of the chapter, since it is actually consistent for him to say both that God seemingly does not judge wicked people now and that God ultimately will judge wicked people in the end. This is not a contradiction, it is a paradox, and the Bible speaks of it in other passages as well. For example, [Ecclesiastes 8:11](https://ref.ly/Eccl8:11) says that because God does not immediately punish people who do wrong, people feel that they can get away with doing wrong. But Ecclesiastes goes on to say in the next verse that even if a sinner might do a hundred evil things and live a long time, it is still better to obey God.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Changing referents of “they”

Job uses the word “they” throughout this chapter to mean both wicked people and the poor people whom they exploit. He does not often indicate when he changing the referent of the word. Notes indicate the referent in each verse. In your translation, to be helpful to your readers, you may wish to specify “wicked people” or “poor people” each time the referent changes.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 24:1

## Job 24:1 (#1) (id: 270947)

**""Why are times not set by the Almighty?"**

**"They remove boundary markers"**

The pronoun **They** refers to wicked people, not to “the ones knowing” God, as it does in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers.

**"they seize the flock and pasture {it"**

Job is not referring to a specific **flock**. He means flocks in general that wicked people steal from vulnerable people such as widows and orphans, whom he names specifically in the next verse.

Job is commenting here on the injustice of wicked people having poor people **tread their winepresses** but then not giving them any of the wine to drink. (In this culture, the water was often unsafe to drink. People drank wine to quench their thirst, and, because the wine had a low alcohol content, they could do that without getting drunk. Job is not saying that the wicked people should have given the poor people wine so that they could get drunk, only that they should have given them wine to quench their thirst.) See how you expressed the implicit meaning in the previous verse, where Job described how poor people carried grain but went hungry.

If houses in your culture are made of different materials that a thief would not or could not dig through, you may wish to use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “Wicked people break into houses”

## Job 24:16 (#4) (id: 271008)

**"they do not know the light"**

This expression means that wicked people are not familiar with **light**, and the reason is that they do not leave their homes when it is light. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they do not go out when it is light”

## Job 24:16 (#5) (id: 271009)

**"they do not know the light"**

While the word **light** here is literal, since Job is using it to mean **day**, there is also a moral overtone, as in verse 13, where Job said that wicked people rebel against the light, meaning God’s revelation. If your language has a term for “light” that also has these moral connotations, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation.

**"He (is} swift on the face of the waters"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, at this point in his speech, Job implicitly begins to draw a contrast between the present situation of wicked people and their ultimate fate.

Job is speaking as if a wicked person were literally something light that would float on the surface of the **waters** of a brook or river and pass swiftly downstream. He means that a wicked person only flourishes for a short time and then is gone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Since Job speaks of wicked people in the plural in the next phrase, you may wish to use the plural in this phrase as well.

**""Drought and heat strip away the waters of snow;"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language.

## Job 24:20 (#3) (id: 271022)

**"the worm will dine on him"**

The term translated **dine** means to eat with enjoyment. Job is describing an ironic consequence that wicked people will experience. During their lives, as he said earlier, they had oil and wine and grain that they enjoyed but did not share with others. Now, after death, they provide a satisfying meal for the worms that eat them in their graves. Your language may have a term similar to **dine** that you could use in your translation.

The point of this comparison is that just as a **tree** may be **broken** (by a powerful wind, for example) so that it falls over and dies, so a wicked person will lose his possessions and status and ultimately die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and wickedness is broken, just as a windstorm knocks down a tree and it dies”

## Job - Chapter 25 Introduction (id: 718654)

Job 25 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the third and final speech of Job’s friend Bildad.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### The brevity of Bildad’s speech

This speech by Bildad is much shorter than his first two speeches. It is also much shorter than the three speeches that Eliphaz has given to this point in the book and the two speeches that Zophar has given. The likely explanation is that Job’s friends are running out of things to say to him. Indeed, Zophar does not give a third speech at all. The narrator says in [32:3](https://ref.ly/Job32:3) that the three friends “found no answer” for Job’s arguments. The brevity of Bildad’s third speech and the absence of a third speech by Zophar dramatize this. Since the narrator eventually offers an explanation, it would not be necessary to put an explanation in your translation at the end of this chapter such as, “And that was all that Job’s friends had to say to him.”

### God’s holiness and human sinfulness

In this short speech, Bildad describes God’s holiness and human sinfulness. While the points he makes are accurate, they are not convincing for Job, because he has actually been righteous. (See: Holy and Sin and Righteous)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Bildad using the words of Eliphaz

Although Bildad speaks only briefly, he repeats significant phrases from Eliphaz’s first and second speeches. Bildad asks in verse 4, “So how will a man be righteous with God? Or how will one born of a woman be pure?” Eliphaz had asked similarly in 4:17, “Will a man be more righteous than God? If a man will be more pure than his Maker?” and in 15:14, “What is man, that he should be pure, or that one born of a woman should be righteous?” To show this, it would be helpful to use the same wording in your translation of 25:4 that you used in 4:17 and 15:14\.

* **Associated Articles:** Holy (ID: `26698@UWTranslationWords`); Righteous (ID: `27035@UWTranslationWords`); Sin (ID: `27098@UWTranslationWords`)

## Job 25:2 (#1) (id: 271054)

**"Dominion and fear {are} with him"**

The pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Dominion and awe are with God” or “God possesses dominion and awe”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 25:2
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 25:2 (#2) (id: 271055)

**"Dominion and fear {are} with him"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **fear** tells what response God’s **Dominion** produces in those who recognize its powerful and holy character. (In this context, the word **fear** describes reverence and respect for God and awe at his greatness.) If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “Fearful dominion is with him” or “Awesome dominion is with him”

**""Is there a number to his troops?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “There is no number to his troops! His light arises on everyone!”

**"Is there a number to his troops"**

In this verse, Bildad is describing God’s greatness by saying that at night, there are too many stars in the sky to count, and by day, the sun shines all over the world.

**"a man,"** \- **"or a son of man"**

Although the terms **man** and **son** are masculine, here both words have a generic sense that includes both men and women.

## Job 25:6 (#4) (id: 271070)

**"a man, a worm"**

Bildad is speaking as if a human were literally a **worm**. He probably means that humans are lowly, just as worms are lowly, living in the dirt. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that lowly creature”

## Job 25:6 (#5) (id: 271071)

**"or a son of man, a grub"**

Bildad is similarly speaking as if a human were literally a **grub**. Once again the basis of the comparison seems to be that just as grubs live in the earth, God originally formed humans from the earth. So this is a parallel poetic reference to human mortality. Rather than repeat the image, it may be more natural in your language to translate this as an explanatory phrase. Alternate translation, not preceded by a comma: “whom God formed from the earth”

## Job - Chapter 26 Introduction (id: 718655)

Job 26 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins a long response by Job first to Bildad’s last speech and then to the friends in general. Bildad had spoken briefly of the greatness of God. Job shows that he is a truly godly man who appreciates God’s greatness by describing it in this chapter at greater length and in more eloquent language. Job told the friends in 12:3 that he had just as much wisdom as they did, and he demonstrates that in this chapter.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Litany

In verses 7–9, Job makes a series of statements about God that have a similar form. A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litany in chapter 12\. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make each verse in the litany a separate sentence. For example, you could begin verse 7, “God stretches out.” Notes to verses 7–9 offer further suggestions.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Reference of “he,” “him,” and “his”

The pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” all refer to God throughout this chapter. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “God” or “God’s” at regular intervals for clarity.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:1

## Job 26:2 (#1) (id: 271072)

**""How you have helped {the one} without power!"**

For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You have not helped the one without power! You have not saved the arm of no strength”

See: Irony

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:2
* **Associated Articles:** Irony (ID: `33288@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:2 (#2) (id: 271073)

**""How you have helped {the one} without power!"**

Job is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “You have not helped me, even though I was without power! You have not saved me, even though my arm had no strength”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:2 (#3) (id: 271074)

**"you have helped {"** \- **"You have saved"**

In this verse, as well as in verses 3 and 4, the word **you** is singular because Job is addressing Bildad directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:2
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:2 (#4) (id: 271075)

**"the arm of no strength"**

Job is using one part of himself, his **arm**, to mean all of him as someone who is struggling to have **strength** during difficulties. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a person of no strength” or “me, even though I had no strength”

## Job 26:3 (#1) (id: 271076)

**""How you have advised {one} without wisdom!"**

For emphasis, Job is continuing to say the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You have not really advised one without wisdom! You have not really made known insight in abundance”

## Job 26:4 (#1) (id: 271078)

**""With whom did you declare words?"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Someone must have helped you declare those words! Someone else’s breath must have come out from you!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:4 (#2) (id: 271079)

**""With whom did you declare words?"**

Job is implying that God must have helped Bildad speak, although he does not really mean it (see next note). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God must have helped you declare those words! God’s own breath must have come out from you!”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:4 (#3) (id: 271080)

**""With whom did you declare words?"**

For emphasis, Job is continuing to say the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are merely sharing human opinions! You have no divinely granted insights!”

See: Irony

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:4
* **Associated Articles:** Irony (ID: `33288@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:4 (#4) (id: 271081)

**"With whom did you declare words"**

Job is using the term **words** to mean what Bildad has just said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God must have helped you say what you did!” or, showing that Job is saying the opposite of what he means, “What you said was merely your own human opinion”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:4 (#5) (id: 271082)

**"And the breath of whom came out from you"**

The word translated **breath** can also mean “spirit,” so this could mean: (1\) that Job is making a parallel statement to the first part of the verse, using the **breath** that comes out of a person’s mouth while he is speaking to mean the act of speaking itself. Alternate translation: “And who was speaking with you as you spoke” or “And who enabled you to speak so well” or “It is certainly not as if God was helping you speak!” (2\) that Job is suggesting (while meaning the opposite of what he is saying) that an angel or God’s Spirit must have inspired Bildad to say what he did. Alternate translation: “And what spirit inspired you to speak so well” or “And was it not God’s Spirit who inspired you to speak so well”

## Job 26:5 (#1) (id: 271083)

**"The Raphaites tremble"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, at this point in this speech, Job begins a description of the greatness of God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “But as for the greatness of God, the Raphaites tremble”

## Job 26:5 (#2) (id: 271084)

**""from below the waters"**

Job implicitly means that the spirits of dead people **tremble** from their abode in Sheol, which he names specifically in the next verse but which he identifies by its location in this verse. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “from their abode deep below the sea, deep below the creatures that live in the sea”

## Job 26:6 (#1) (id: 271085)

**"Sheol {is} naked before him"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the pronoun **him** in this verse refers to God, as do the pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” throughout the chapter. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, here and at selected other places in the chapter. Alternate translation: “Sheol is naked before God”

## Job 26:6 (#2) (id: 271086)

**"Sheol {is} naked before him"**

Job is speaking of **Sheol** as if it were literally not wearing any clothing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Sheol is open before God” or “God can look right into Sheol”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:6
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:6 (#4) (id: 271088)

**"and {there is} no covering to Abaddon"**

Job is speaking as if it might be possible to put an actual **covering** over **Abaddon** to keep God from seeing into it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and nothing keeps God from seeing into Abaddon”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:7 (#1) (id: 271089)

**""the one stretching out the north over nothingness,"**

Job is using the two major components of creation, the sky (which he calls the **north**) and the **earth**, to mean all of creation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the one having made all of creation where previously nothing was”

See: Merism

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:7
* **Associated Articles:** Merism (ID: `33291@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:7 (#2) (id: 271090)

**""the one stretching out the north over nothingness,"**

Job is speaking as if God had literally stretched out the **north** (the sky) over **nothingness** and hung the **earth** on **nothing**. Since he speaks of the “pillars” of the heavens in verse 11, he is probably not saying directly that the sky and the earth are suspended over empty space. Instead, he is probably referring to God having created the sky and the land by bringing order to watery chaos. Job says this specifically in verses 12 and 13\. Alternate translation: “the one having created the sky and the land by bringing order to watery chaos”

## Job 26:7 (#3) (id: 271091)

**"the one stretching out"**

## Job 26:7 (#4) (id: 271092)

**"the one stretching out"**

The pronoun **one** refers to God, not to Abaddon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God is the one stretching out”

* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:7 (#5) (id: 271093)

**"the north"**

Job is using the term **north** by association to mean the bright constellations in the northern sky, and so by further association the stars, and by even further association the sky itself, where the stars appear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the sky”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:8 (#1) (id: 271094)

**""the one binding the waters in his clouds,"**

Job is speaking as if God literally uses **clouds** to bind or tie up the waters that eventually fall from those clouds to earth as rain. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “God makes rainclouds that contain much water”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:8
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:8 (#2) (id: 271095)

**"but the cloud is not torn under them"**

Job is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds, specifically rainclouds, in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “but those rainclouds are not torn under those waters”

See: Generic Noun Phrases

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:8
* **Associated Articles:** Generic Noun Phrases (ID: `33277@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:8 (#3) (id: 271096)

**"but the cloud is not torn under them"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but those waters do not tear the clouds under them” or “but the weight of those waters does not tear the clouds apart”

## Job 26:9 (#1) (id: 271097)

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:9 (#2) (id: 271098)

**"his cloud"**

Job is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means all the clouds that God would use to cover the moon. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “his clouds”

* **Associated Articles:** Generic Noun Phrases (ID: `33277@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:10 (#1) (id: 271099)

**"He has circled a limit on the face of the waters"**

Job is speaking as if the surface of the **waters** or oceans were literally their **face**. He is describing the horizon, which, to a land\-bound observer, seems to be a limit on how far the oceans extend. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God has placed a circular limit on the surface of the oceans”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 26:10
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:10 (#2) (id: 271100)

**"unto the boundary of light with darkness"**

Job implicitly means that the **limit** that God has placed on the extent of the oceans coincides with the bottom of the dome of the sky, which people in this culture considered to be a solid object. Beneath the dome, in which the sun, moon, and stars shone, there was light. Beyond the dome was darkness. So Job is using **the boundary of light with darkness** to refer by association to the sky. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “at the bottom of the dome of the sky”

## Job 26:11 (#1) (id: 271101)

**""The pillars of the heavens tremble"**

Many interpreters believe that here Job is speaking of high mountains as if they were the **pillars of the heavens**, since they appear to hold up the sky. Job would also be speaking as if God were literally issuing a **rebuke** to the mountains and that in response, they **tremble and marvel**. The reference may be to an earthquake, which causes mountains to shake. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God sends earthquakes that make even the high mountains shake”

See: Personification

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 26:11 (#2) (id: 271102)

**""tremble"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **marvel**, a reference to being astonished by the power of God, tells why the pillars of the heavens **tremble**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “shake with fear”

## Job 26:13 (#1) (id: 271104)

**"By his breath the skies {become} clearness"**

Job is probably speaking as if strong winds, which clear the clouds from the sky after a storm, are the **breath** of God. Even though the word translated **breath** can also mean “wind” or “Spirit,” Job is probably using a poetic image rather than a literal statement to describe the power of God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God sends strong winds to clear the sky of clouds after a storm”

## Job - Chapter 27 Introduction (id: 718656)

Job 27 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Bildad and the other two friends.

* Verses 1–10: Job insists that he is godly and will continue to live that way
* Verses 11–23: Job describes how God punishes wicked people

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Reference of “he,” “him,” and “his”

From verse 14 through to the end of the chapter, the pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to the “wicked man” whom Job first mentions in verse 13\. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “a wicked man” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do this at various places.

## Job 27:1 (#1) (id: 271111)

**"And Job continued to take up his discourse, and he said"**

The narrator is speaking as if Job’s **discourse** or speech were an object that he could **take up** or pick up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “As Job continued his speech, he said” or “Job continued speaking and he said”

## Job 27:2 (#1) (id: 271112)

**""As} God lives, {who} has taken away my justice,"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “As God lives, who has taken away my justice; as the Almighty lives, who has made my life bitter”

**""As} God lives, {who} has taken away my justice,"**

Job is swearing an oath in the way that was characteristic in his culture. In your translation, you can translate this in the way that would be characteristic in your culture. Alternate translation: “I swear by God, who has turned away my justice; I swear by the Almighty, who has made my life bitter”

## Job 27:3 (#1) (id: 271115)

**"that"**

Job is using the word **that** to introduce the content of the oath that he began to swear in the previous verse. In some cases, if you translated the previous verse to reflect the way people swear oaths in your culture, you may not need to include the word **that** here. If you chose to reflect the way Job swore this oath following the practices of his own culture, it may be helpful to show what he is using the word **that** to mean. Alternate translation: “I swear that”

## Job 27:3 (#2) (id: 271116)

**"and breath from God {being} in my nose"**

Job is using the **breath** in his **nose** by association to mean breathing, and he is using breathing by association to mean being alive. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and for as long as I draw the breath of life” or “and for as long as I am alive”

## Job 27:4 (#1) (id: 271117)

**""if my lips speak wickedness,"**

This is the conclusion of the oath that Job is swearing. In this culture, people would swear an oath by stating the first part of a condition but not the second part. (But see the General Notes to chapter 31, which explain how Job does state the second part of many conditions in the oaths that he swears in that chapter.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explicitly state the implied second part of the condition. Alternate translation: “if my lips speak wickedness, or if my tongue utters deceit, may God punish me severely!”

**""May my enemy be like the wicked,"**

In this culture, people would make clear that they did not want something to happen to them by saying they wanted it to happen to their enemies. That showed that it was the opposite of what they wanted for themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

Job is using the adjectives **righteous** and **innocent** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “but a righteous person … an innocent person”

## Job 27:18 (#1) (id: 271160)

**""He builds his house as a moth {does},"**

The point of these comparisons is that the **house** of a **moth**, that is, its cocoon, is very fragile, as is a **hut** that a **guard** would build in a field out of branches to watch over crops during harvest time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “The house that he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon, as rickety as a hut that a guard would build out of branches”

## Job 27:18 (#2) (id: 271161)

**""He builds his house as a moth {does},"**

While the actual house of a wicked person might become abandoned and collapse from neglect, Job could be using the term **house** to represent the life of that person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The life that he creates for himself is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon, as rickety as a hut that a guard would build from branches”

## Job 27:18 (#3) (id: 271162)

**"He builds his house as a moth {does"**

A **moth** is a flying insect that is typically active at night. It begins life as a wingless larva. The larva eventually spins a silk cocoon around itself, and inside that cocoon, it changes into a flying moth. If your readers would not be familiar with what a moth is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable creature that your readers would recognize and that similarly builds a fragile structure. The UST models one way to do this.

## Job 27:19 (#1) (id: 271163)

**"He lies down rich,"** \- **"he opens his eyes"**

Job is speaking of going to sleep and waking up by association with things that people do when they go to sleep (lie down in bed) and wake up (open their eyes).

## Job 27:19 (#2) (id: 271164)

**"He lies down rich,"** \- **"he opens his eyes"**

Job is making an overstatement to emphasize how quickly a wicked person loses his wealth. He is speaking as if that person would go to sleep rich and wake up with nothing, that is, as if he would lose all of his riches in a single night. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “He may be rich … only a short time passes”

**"a storm carries him away in the night"**

Job is speaking as if a **storm** would literally carry a wicked person away. He means that that person perishes as quickly and unexpectedly as he would if a storm carried him away.

**""The east wind takes him away, and he leaves;"**

Job is continuing to speak as if a **wind** would literally pick up a wicked person and carry him away. If you decided to represent this image as a comparison in the previous verse, you can continue to do that in this verse.

**"And it hurls {itself} upon him and does not pity"**

Job is speaking of this wind as if it were a living thing that could hurl itself upon a wicked person and not **pity** him, that is, not show him any mercy. If you decided to represent this image as a comparison in the previous two verses, you can continue to do that in this verse.

## Job 27:22 (#2) (id: 271171)

**"fleeing, he flees"**

Job is repeating the verb “flee” in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. The specific sense here is that the wicked person is trying desperately to flee from this strong wind. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “he tries desperately to escape” or “it is as if he is trying desperately to escape”

**"It claps its hands at him"**

In this culture, people would clap their hands together as a symbolic action to express negative emotions such as grief, indignation, or derision. In this context, Job is speaking as if the wind were expressing derision at the wicked person. If it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if people in your culture clap their hands together to express positive emotions such as approval and admiration, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation. You could also name a gesture that people in your culture use to express derision. Alternate translation: “It is as if such a wind claps its hands at him in derision” or “It is as if such a wind points its finger derisively at him”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation.

(Job says of the wind in verse 21, “it blasts him from his place.”) Alternate translation: “from within his former home, which this wind now occupies” (2\) that the wind **hisses** at the wicked person now that he is out of **his place**.

## Job - Chapter 28 Introduction (id: 718657)

Job 28 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Bildad and the other two friends. In this part of his speech, Job discusses how people can obtain wisdom. Both he and his friends have stressed the importance of wisdom (for example, in 12:2, 15:8, and 26:3\). Job says at the end of this eloquent discussion, “Behold, the fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to turn from evil is understanding.” The implication is that Job, who prizes wisdom so much, would not have disrespected God, committed evil, and thus missed out on having wisdom. So in this chapter, Job gives another important defense of his innocence.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Reference of “it” in verses 13–18

Job introduces the subject of “wisdom” in verse 12\. Then, from verse 14 through to the end of the chapter, he refers to wisdom most of the time with the pronouns “it” and “its.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “wisdom” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do this at various places.

**"it is overturned as with fire"**

Job assumes that his friends will understand that he is using the term **fire** to refer to an ancient mining practice. Miners would build fires against the walls of mines to heat the rock.

## Job - Chapter 29 Introduction (id: 718658)

Job 29 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Job’s final response to his three friends. In this chapter, Job recalls the honor he enjoyed and the influence he exercised within his community before he suffered so many misfortunes.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Litany

In verses 2–6, Job makes a series of statements about what his life was like before his present troubles. He expresses a wish in verse 2 that his life could be like this again, and in verses 3–6 he offers a series of descriptions that each begin with “when” or “as that.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litany in chapter 12\. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make each verse in the litany a separate sentence. For example, you could begin verse 3, “At that time.”

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Reference of “they” in verses 21–25

Job uses “they” in verses 21–25 as an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify a general referent such as “people” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do that at various places.

## Job 29:7 (#1) (id: 271277)

## Job 29:8 (#1) (id: 271278)

**"and hid themselves"**

This expression does not mean that these **young men** looked for hiding places where no one would find them. It means that they moved back from the place where the leaders sat, blending into the crowd. The idea is that before Job came, they thought they might have something to contribute to the deliberations after their elders had spoken, as Elihu does in this book starting in chapter 32\. But once Job arrived, they knew that his wise counsel would settle matters and they would have no need or opportunity to contribute. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and withdrew” or “and stepped aside out of respect”

## Job 29:8 (#2) (id: 271279)

**"rose, they stood"**

The terms **rose** and **stood** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “stood to their feet”

## Job 29:9 (#1) (id: 271281)

## Job 29:9 (#2) (id: 271282)

**"and they put a hand on their mouth"**

Since Job is speaking of many people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural forms of **hand** and **mouth**. Alternate translation: “and they put their hands on their mouths” or “and they covered their mouths with their hands”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 29:9
* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: `33324@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 29:9 (#3) (id: 271283)

**"and they put a hand on their mouth"**

Covering the **mouth** with the **hand** prevents a person from speaking. While the **princes** could simply have stopped talking without doing that, they did it as a symbolic action to show respect for Job, indicating that there was nothing they could say that would be more valuable than what he would say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and they covered their mouths with their hands to indicate respectfully that there was nothing they could say that would be more valuable than what I would say”

**"The voice of"** \- **"and their tongue"** \- **"to their palate"**

**"and their tongue stuck to their palate"**

Job is speaking as if the **tongue** of each noble literally **stuck** to his **palate**, that is, to the roof of his mouth. He means that they did not say anything, as no one could say anything if his tongue truly had become stuck in this way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they did not say anything”

**"For"**

Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the preceding verses that these various groups of people kept silent when he arrived at the city gate.

**"the afflicted"**

The term **afflicted** may seem like a passive verbal form, but it is actually an adjective. It indicates people who are suffering from affliction, not people whom others have afflicted.

**"and the case {that} I did not know, I examined it"**

Job is referring implicitly to a **case** whose details he did not **know** before someone brought it to the city gate for adjudication. Job did not know these details because he was not personally acquainted with the person bringing the case. So he was not motivated by friendship or family loyalty, but simply by the interests of justice. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.

The point of this comparison is that just as **sand** consists of a very large number of grains, so Job expected to live for a very large number of days. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “after I have lived for very many days” or “after I have lived for a long time”

**""My root is spread out to the waters,"**

## Job 29:19 (#2) (id: 271316)

**""My root is spread out to the waters,"**

Job spoke of himself in those days as if he were literally a tree that was healthy and flourishing because it was getting all the moisture that it required. Since Job is describing what he used to say, it may be good to retain this image in your translation, but if it would be more natural in your language, you could express it as a comparison. Alternate translation: “I said that I was like a tree that was healthy and flourishing because it was getting all the moisture that it required through roots that reached down to ground water and through dew that formed at night on its branches”

**"and my bow sprouts in my hand"**

Job is speaking as if he had a **bow**, a weapon that he used with arrows, and that it grew freshly in his **hand** the way that a branch sprouts from a tree trunk. (Job uses the same verb for “sprout” in [14:7–9](https://ref.ly/Job14:7-Job14:9) to describe a tree reviving and sending out shoots when moisture returns to the ground.) He means that the bow, which represents his strength, is lively and vigorous. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Job 29:21 (#2) (id: 271323)

**"They listened"**

**They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. (As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Job continues to use the pronoun “they” with this same indefinite sense through to the end of the chapter.) If it would be helpful in your language, here and in the following verses you could translate the term with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “People listened”

## Job 29:22 (#2) (id: 271325)

**"for my speech dripped on them"**

Job is speaking as if his speech literally **dripped**, that is, fell in drops, on his listeners. He means that it was refreshing and invigorating to them, like gentle rain. This enabled them to recognize that he was giving sound advice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Job 29:23 (#1) (id: 271326)

**"And they waited for me as {for} rain"**

The point of this comparison is that just as people are eager for rain to fall and water their crops, so Job’s listeners were eager to hear him speak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “And people as waited eagerly to hear me speak as they wait for rain to fall on their crops”

## Job 29:23 (#2) (id: 271327)

**"and they opened their mouth {as} for the latter rain"**

Job is using a complex image here. First, he is speaking as if the people listening to him were literally the ground. Second, he is speaking of the ground soaking up rainfall as if it were opening its **mouth** to drink water. Job does not mean that the people opened their mouths to speak; he is actually describing them listening. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Yes, they were eager to listen to everything I said, just as the dry ground soaks up the latter rain when it falls”

**"as} for the latter rain"**

In the region where the book of Job was composed, people would plant crops in the fall. Rain at that time would help the crops start growing. But farmers depended on later rains, which would fall in the spring after an interval during which little rain fell, to enable the crops grow to maturity. Express this in a way that would be meaningful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as for the rain that falls again after the dry season”

## Job 29:24 (#3) (id: 271331)

**"and they did not cause the light of my face to fall"**

Job is speaking as if there had been light shining from his face. He is describing a cheerful facial expression that indicated hope and a favorable disposition. Job is also using a further characteristic image for facial expressions. In this culture, people would say that someone “lifted up” his face if he made a cheerful expression but that his face “fell” if he made a gloomy expression. Job means that he did not let the situations of the people he wanted to help discourage him. Job is combining the two images and saying that they did not cause the light of his face to fall. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different image that has this meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I did not let their situations discourage me”

**"and I dwelt like a king in an army"**

In this culture, kings would accompany their armies into the field as their commanders. The point of this comparison is probably that just as the authority of a **king** would be unquestioned within his **army**, so people did not question Job’s directions as their leader.

## Job - Chapter 30 Introduction (id: 718659)

Job 30 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Job’s final response to his three friends.

* Verses 1–14: Job describes the disrespect he now experiences because he has suffered so many misfortunes
* Verses 15–19: Job describes his sufferings
* Verses 20–23: Job addresses God directly to complain that God has not helped him
* Verses 34–31: Job describes how he is suffering even though he helped others when they suffered

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Reference of “they” in verses 2–10

In verses 2–10, Job uses the pronouns “they,” “them,” and “their” to mean the young men who now treat him disrespectfully. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify this reference at regular intervals for clarity. Various notes suggest ways to do that. (In verse 5, as a note will clarify, one instance of “they” refers to other people.)

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:1

## Job 30:1 (#1) (id: 271337)

**"the fewer in days than me"**

Job is using the adjective phrase **fewer in days** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. (He is contrasting his present situation, in which younger people now disrespect him, with the way that “young men” formerly withdrew respectfully from his presence and “old men” stood up out of respect for him, as he described in [29:8](https://ref.ly/Job29:8).) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “those who are much younger than I am”

See: Nominal Adjectives

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:1
* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:1 (#2) (id: 271338)

**"whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock"**

The implications of this statement is that the **fathers** of the young men who now **laugh at** Job were shiftless and incompetent. This could mean: (1\) that Job would not employ these men to do even such menial tasks as shepherd **dogs** do. Alternate translation: “whose fathers I could not even employ to do menial tasks” (2\) that Job would not specifically employ these men as shepherds for his flocks, working with his sheepdogs. Alternate translation: “whose fathers I would not even employ as shepherds”

## Job 30:2 (#1) (id: 271339)

**"the strength of their hands, for what {is it} to me"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I have no use for the strength of their hands!” or “the strength of their hands is useless to me!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:2 (#2) (id: 271340)

**"the strength of their hands, for what {is it} to me"**

Job is using one part of these young men, their **hands**, to mean all of them in the act of using **strength** to work. As the rest of the verse indicates, these young men have only feeble strength. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have no use for their feeble strength!” or “their feeble strength is useless to me!”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:2
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:2 (#3) (id: 271341)

**"In them old age has perished"**

Job is speaking of **old age** as if it were a living thing that has **perished** in these young men. Eliphaz uses the same term for “old age” in 5:26\. There it means the maturity and accomplishment that come from a long life well lived. Here the term seems to indicate the vigor that someone would have in his youth that would enable him to live such a long life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They have lost the vigor that would have enabled them to live a long life” or “They have lost their youthful vigor”

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:2 (#4) (id: 271342)

**"In them"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the pronoun **them** refers to the young men who now treat Job disrespectfully, as do the pronouns “they,” “them,” and “their” in verses 4–10\. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “In these young men”

## Job 30:3 (#1) (id: 271343)

**"ones gnawing the dry land"**

Job is speaking of the **dry land** by association to mean the roots that grow in the land, as the next verse makes clear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These young men gnaw on the roots that they find in the ground”

## Job 30:3 (#2) (id: 271344)

**"the dry land yesterday {in} waste and desolation"**

The term **yesterday** could mean: (1\) time gone by. Alternate translation: “the land that has long been dry, a waste and desolation” (2\) the darkness of the night that precedes day. Alternate translation: “the dry land in the gloom of waste and desolation”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:3 (#3) (id: 271345)

**"in} waste and desolation"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **desolation** tells what kind of **waste** this is. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “in a desolate wasteland”

* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:4 (#1) (id: 271346)

**"mallow"**

The word **mallow** describes a kind of flowering plant whose leaves are edible. Your language may have a name of its own for this plant that you could use in your translation. If your readers would not be familiar with the plant, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “desert plants”

## Job 30:4 (#2) (id: 271347)

**"and the root of broom trees {is} their bread"**

Since Job is speaking of many roots, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **root**. Alternate translation: “and the roots of broom trees are their bread”

See: Collective Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:4
* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: `33324@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:4 (#3) (id: 271348)

**"broom trees"**

A **broom** tree is a kind of shrub that grows in desert areas. If your readers would not be familiar with this shrub, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable one that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “shrubs”

See: Translate Unknowns

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:4
* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: `33408@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:4 (#4) (id: 271349)

**"is} their bread"**

Job is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. While the roots of the **broom** tree are edible, they have a bitter taste, and only a desperate person would eat them. So there is a sense here that the people whom Job is describing eat these roots out of desperation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is their food” or “is all they have to eat”

## Job 30:5 (#1) (id: 271350)

**"They are driven out"**

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:5 (#2) (id: 271351)

**"from the midst"**

Job means implicitly that these young men are **driven out** from the **midst** of human community. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “from society”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:5 (#3) (id: 271352)

**"they shout after them"**

Here the pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. It means the people of society in general. (The pronoun **them** refers to the young men whom Job has been describing.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “people shout after these young men”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 30:5
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:5 (#4) (id: 271353)

**"as {after} a thief"**

Job is speaking of people chasing others away, so this seems to be a reference to people shouting at a would\-be **thief** in order to call attention to him and get him to flee before he steals something. Job is probably not referring to people shouting to get others to pursue and apprehend a thief who has already stolen something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “as they would shout to chase away a would\-be thief”

## Job 30:6 (#1) (id: 271354)

**"to dwell"**

This phrase indicates the result of what Job describes in the previous verse, “They are driven out from the midst.” It may be helpful to indicate that explicitly, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As a result, they have to live”

## Job 30:6 (#2) (id: 271355)

**"on the slope of wadis"**

Since Job is speaking of the slopes of many **wadis**, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **slope**. Alternate translation: “on the slopes of wadis”

* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: `33324@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 30:6 (#3) (id: 271356)

**"in} holes of the dust"**

Job is using one part of the ground, the **dust** on its surface, to mean the ground itself. **Iron** is actually **taken** from deep in the ground. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in holes in the ground”

**"they bray"**

Job is speaking as if these young men literally **bray** as if they were donkeys. He likely means that they moan with hunger, as wild animals cry out when they need food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “these young men moan with hunger”

## Job 30:8 (#1) (id: 271359)

**"Sons of a fool, indeed, sons of {one} without a name"**

Job is not referring to a specific **fool** or person **without a name**. He means such people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express these meanings by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “Sons of fools, indeed, sons of people without names”

## Job 30:8 (#2) (id: 271360)

**"Sons of a fool, indeed, sons of {one} without a name"**

Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be helpful to your readers. However, you might also leave the words out in order to show the force of this exclamation, with which Job concludes his description of these young men.

**"Sons of a fool, indeed, sons of {one} without a name"**

In this context, the expression **sons of** describes people who share the qualities of something. Job is using this expression to describe the behavior and character of these young men. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. The word **fool** here does not indicate someone who lacks intelligence or education; it means someone who chooses to disobey God, thinking there will be no consequences. The word **name** here means a good reputation. Alternate translation: “People who foolishly think they can disobey God! No wonder they are people of no reputation”

**"and I am a word for them"**

The meaning of the term **word** here is the same as the meaning of the term “saying” in [17:6](https://ref.ly/Job17:6). Job means that these young men are citing him by name as an outstanding example of someone who seemed to be prospering because he was righteous but who came to ruin because he was actually wicked. Your language may have an expression for this practice of citing people by name as examples, and you may be able to use that expression in your translation.

**"On {my} right the brood arise"**

The right side was usually the most dangerous side on which to approach an enemy soldier, since a majority of soldiers were right\-handed and would use their right hands and arms to wield their swords.

**"they thrust aside my foot"**

Job is using one part of himself, his **foot**, to mean all of him in the act of walking. He probably means that as he is walking on the road, when these young men are approaching from the opposite direction, they do not stand respectfully aside so that he can pass. Instead, they shove him out of the way so that they can pass. When young men traveling in the same direction overtake him, they similarly push him aside so that they can go by.

The implication is that this darkened skin makes him appear as if he is a manual laborer who works out in the sun. [1:6](https://ref.ly/Song1:6) suggests that in this culture, a person in that situation would be less respected than someone who could employ others to do outdoor work and so did not have sun\-darkened skin.

## Job - Chapter 31 Introduction (id: 718660)

Job 31 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the conclusion of Job’s final response to his three friends.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Litany

In verses 1–34 and 38–40, Job swears a series of oaths to insist on his innocence. Typically he uses a statement that begins with “if” to suggest something he might have done wrong, and he then uses a statement that uses verbal forms such as “may” or “let” to wish that he would receive an appropriate punishment if he has indeed committed such a sin. In some cases, rather than wish for punishment, Job gives a reason why he would not have committed the sin he has described. In some other cases, Job makes only the “if” statement, leaving the rest of the conditional statement to be inferred. Notes throughout the chapter indicate how Job responds to each of the “if” statements that he makes.

A series of similar statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litanies in chapters 9, 12, 26, and 29\. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs\-litany and rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing\-oathformula)

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Job’s understanding of appropriate punishment for sin

In this chapter, Job insists that he has been righteous by wishing aloud that he would receive the just punishment for any crimes that he may have committed. In most cases, Job himself would suffer the punishment that he describes. But in verses 9 and 10, Job says that if he has committed adultery with another man’s wife, then may other men have sexual relations with his wife. It seems that Job is wishing that God would punish his wife for something that he himself had done. Since the book describes Job as a wise and righteous, it appears that readers are supposed to consider that this would be a just punishment, but it does not seem to be just or fair. One way to understand this may be to consider that Job is saying that if he has been unfaithful to his wife, then may his wife be unfaithful to him in return. This is not the ideal that the Bible as a whole teaches. As Christians, we are not supposed to take revenge on others by doing to them what they have done to us. But in this specific context, in which Job is swearing oaths to guarantee his innocence, having his wife be unfaithful to him if he had been unfaithful to her would be a punishment that fit the crime, and Job is insisting on his innocence by saying that he is prepared to receive the punishments that fit any crimes he has committed.

## Job 31:1 (#1) (id: 271436)

**"I have cut a covenant with my eyes"**

In this culture, people would say that they had **cut** a **covenant** because making a covenant often involved a ceremony in which the two parties would cut up an animal and walk between the cut\-up pieces. [Jeremiah 34:18](https://ref.ly/Jer34:18) refers to such a ceremony, and [Genesis 15:8–19](https://ref.ly/Gen15:8-Gen15:19) describes God making a covenant with Abraham in this way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have made a covenant with my eyes”

## Job 31:1 (#5) (id: 271440)

**"upon a virgin"**

Job is using one kind of woman, a **virgin**, to mean women in general. He is not saying that if a woman had not had sexual relations with anyone, he would not look at her lustfully, but if a woman had had sexual relations, then he might look at her lustfully. Job is mentioning a virgin as one example of a woman whom he might be tempted to look at that way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Job 31:2 (#1) (id: 271441)

**""For what {would be} the portion from God above,"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This could mean: (1\) a good **portion** and **inheritance** as a reward for obedience. These terms typically have a positive meaning. Alternate translation: “For then there would be no portion from God above or inheritance from the Almighty in the heights!” (2\) a bad **portion** and **inheritance**, that is, a punishment, for disobedience. This would mean the same thing that Job says in the next verse. Alternate translation: “For then the portion from God above would not be good, nor the inheritance from the Almighty in the heights”

**""let him weigh me in balances of righteousness,"**

In this verse, Job interrupts the if\-then statement he is making in verses 5, 7, and 8\. He does that in order to assert that if God judges him fairly, then God will recognize that he does not deserve the punishment he describes in verse 8 or any of the other punishments he describes in this chapter. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this assertion before the if\-then statement by creating a verse bridge for verses 5–6\.

**"my heart"** \- **"a spot"**

**"or a spot has stuck to my hands"**

As in [17:9](https://ref.ly/Job17:9), Job is speaking as if people who are innocent of wrongdoing literally have clean **hands**, so that when he speaks of a **spot** or stain having **stuck** to his **hands**, he is raising the issue of whether he has done something wrong.

**"If my heart has been opened by a woman"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. However, be careful to translate Job’s meaning accurately. Job is not describing a situation in which a woman would be essentially responsible for seducing him. He is describing a situation in which he would not have exercised self\-control over what he looked at (as described in verse 1\) and in which he allowed the beauty of a woman to entice him to do something he knew was wrong.

**"may my wife grind for another"**

## Job 31:12 (#4) (id: 271476)

**"it consumes unto Abaddon"**

Job is speaking of the **fire** that he is using to represent adultery as if it burns everything in its path right down to the underworld. As a note to [26:6](https://ref.ly/Job26:6) explains, the word **Abaddon** is another name for Sheol. However, the word literally means “destruction,” and Job may be using it in that sense, even within the image of this fire. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it burns until everything before it is completely destroyed”

## Job 31:12 (#5) (id: 271477)

**""**

Job is also speaking as if adultery were something that would **uproot** his entire **harvest**. He is probably using this image to represent the loss of all of his possessions. [Proverbs 6:26–35](https://ref.ly/Prov6:26-Prov6:35) indicates that in this culture, men found guilty of adultery could have to pay great amounts in fines and compensation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and it could cost me all of my possessions” or “and it could make me lose all of my wealth”

Job is asking implicitly what he would do if God **arose** or stood up to bring charges against him. As a note to [20:27](https://ref.ly/Job20:27) explains, in order to begin a case against someone, people in this culture would stand up among those who had gathered in the public square.

## Job 31:14 (#3) (id: 271481)

**"Or if he visited"**

Job is using the term **visited** in a particular sense. When applied to God, the term often indicates that God takes action in the life of a person or group, whether to help needy people or to punish guilty people. For example, [Ruth 1:6](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:6) says that Naomi, who had left Israel because of a famine, returned there after she heard that “Yahweh had visited his people, giving them bread.” Here the sense is that God would “visit” Job to help Job’s servants and to punish him for mistreating them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or if he came to help my servants”

Job is speaking as if his **hand** were a living thing that could have **kissed** his **mouth**. He means that if he had wanted to offer worship to the sun or the moon, following the customs of this culture, he would have touched his hand to his mouth in a kiss and then waved the kiss up to the sun or the moon.

**"because evil found him"**

Job is speaking of **evil** as if it were a living thing that could have **found** someone who hated him. Here the word **evil** has the sense of “misfortune” rather than of moral wrong.

**"the men of my tent"**

Although Job refers to his male and female servants separately in [31:13](https://ref.ly/Job31:13), Job is likely using the masculine term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

**"Who will give one {who} has not been satisfied from his flesh"**

Job’s servants would be using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. (In this context, unlike elsewhere in the book, the expression **Who will give** does not express a wish. The servants are not saying, “We wish there was one who has not been satisfied.”) Alternate translation: “No one can show anyone who has not been satisfied from his flesh!” or, positively, “Everyone has been satisfied from his flesh!”

**"Behold, my mark"**

It appears that in this culture, both parties in a legal proceeding would submit their arguments to the court in writing and that they would sign them with their names or with a **mark** to authenticate them. Job is speaking as if he is putting his mark on a written record of his testimony in order to declare that everything he has just said is true. (It seems unlikely that he has actually put all of his testimony in writing, since this is not an actual court proceeding and God would not be submitting a corresponding written document.)

## Job - Chapter 32 Introduction (id: 718661)

Job 32 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter introduces a younger man named Elihu, who has been listening to the conversation between Job and his three friends. Elihu explains that he waited for the friends to speak first, out of respect for their age. But since they have not been able to answer Job effectively, he would now like to speak himself. Elihu continues to speak through chapter 37\.

The ULT sets the lines 32:6–22 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because those verses are poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Reference of “you” and “your”

In verses 6 and 11–14, Elihu says “you” and “your” in order to refer to Job’s three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

### “words” meaning speaking or what a person says

Several times in verses 11–18, Elihu uses the term “words” to mean speaking or what a person says by using words. The narrator also uses the term in that sense in verse 4\. Notes suggest ways to translate the term “words” in these various individual contexts.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 32:1

## Job 32:1 (#1) (id: 271552)

**"the three of these men"**

By **the three of these men**, the narrator implicitly means Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar”

## Job 32:1 (#2) (id: 271553)

**"in his eyes"**

The narrator is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in his own perspective”

## Job 32:2 (#1) (id: 271554)

**"Then the nose burned of Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram. His nose burned against Job"**

See how you translated the word **nose** in [9:5](https://ref.ly/Job9:5). The narrator is speaking as if Elihu’s **nose** or anger could literally have **burned**. He means that Elihu became very angry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He became very angry against Job”

## Job 32:2 (#2) (id: 271555)

**"Then"** \- **"burned"**

The narrator is using the word translated **Then** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

## Job 32:2 (#3) (id: 271556)

**"Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram"**

The author is introducing **Elihu** as a new participant in the story by naming his father, his people group, and his clan. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. You may wish to indicate in your translation, as the UST does, that Elihu had been listening as Job spoke with his three friends.

**"Elihu"** \- **"Barakel the Buzite,"** \- **"Ram"**

The words **Elihu**, **Barakel**, and **Ram** are the names of men. **Buzite** is the name of the people group to which Elihu belonged. The term identifies him as one of the descendants of a man named Buz.

## Job 32:3 (#2) (id: 271559)

**"but they had declared Job wrong"**

A marginal notation in traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible indicates that scribes changed this reading from “they had declared God wrong” to **they had declared Job wrong**. The scribes made this change in order to avoid the uncomfortable suggestion that God could be declared wrong. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “and so they had made it appear as if God were wrong”

## Job 32:4 (#1) (id: 271560)

**"Now Elihu had awaited Job with words, because they {were} older in days than he {was"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Now Job’s friends were much older than Elihu, so he had waited until they had finished speaking to Job before he spoke himself”

## Job 32:15 (#1) (id: 271583)

**""They are dismayed; they do not answer any longer;"**

Elihu has been speaking directly to Job’s friends in the second person, but in this verse he starts speaking about them in the third person. This could mean: (1\) that Elihu is now speaking to himself, but out loud, about the people to whom he had been speaking. He would be doing that to indicate in a strong way how he feels about those people. Alternate translation: “I am indignant that Job’s friends are dismayed and are no longer answering him and have nothing further to say to him” (2\) that Elihu is now speaking about Job’s friends to others who are present. (It is unlikely that Elihu is turning to address Job himself here; Elihu begins addressing Job directly by name in [33:1](https://ref.ly/Job33:1).) Alternate translation: “Look, all the rest of you, at how Job’s friends are dismayed and are no longer answering him and have nothing further to say to him!” Since Job’s friends can hear what Elihu is saying, and since he is saying it partly for their benefit, you could also continue to use the second person in your translation, as the UST does.

## Job - Chapter 33 Introduction (id: 718662)

Job 33 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu addresses Job directly. He invites Job to listen to him, summarizes what Job has said, and tells Job that he is wrong that God does not respond to people. Elihu says that God speaks to people in dreams to warn them not to keep sinning. He says that God also uses sickness to correct people. The implications are that Job’s sufferings are a warning from God not to sin; they are not a punishment from God for sins that Job has committed. In that sense, as Elihu says at the end of the chapter, Job has been right and his friends have been wrong about what has been happening to Job.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### ransom

In verse 24, Elihu describes how God may say of a person who is suffering because of his sin, “I have found a ransom.” The term “ransom” can describe a payment that is made in exchange for someone’s freedom. The term “redeem,” which Elihu uses earlier in that verse, can similarly mean to make a payment in order to have someone set free. However, in this context, the term “ransom” seems to describe instead a valuable consideration, not necessarily a monetary one, that provides the grounds for sparing someone from punishment. Be sure that it is clear in your translation of this verse that God is not saying that he is going to make a payment to someone else on behalf of the suffering person.

A further implication seems to be that the person whom Elihu is describing has repented because of his sufferings after an interpreting angel has explained to him the change needed in his actions. This repentance shows that the person has responded positively to God’s initiatives to get him to stop living in the wrong way and to start living in the right way once again. Be sure that it is also clear in your translation of verse 24 that there is nothing that the person has done to redeem or ransom himself. As Elihu says, God “is gracious to him.” It is God who brings the sickness into the person’s life to “chasten” him, and it is God who sends the angel to warn and admonish the person, and so the person is spared from punishment through the actions of God.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “words” meaning speaking or what a person says

As in chapter 32, many times in this chapter Elihu uses the term “words” to mean speaking or what a person says by using words. Notes suggest ways to translate the term “words” in these various individual contexts.

### reference of “you” and “your”

Throughout this chapter, Elihu uses the pronouns “you” and “your” to address Job individually, so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

### “man” and “men” with generic meaning

In several places in this chapter, Elihu uses the words “man” and “men” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Notes suggest translation possibilities at various places (See: When Masculine Words Include Women).

### “seals their correction” or “terrifies them with warnings” (verse 16\)

In verse 16, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “seals their correction.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “terrifies them with warnings,” and some translations say that. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

Elihu is reasserting the reason he gave in [32:8](https://ref.ly/Job32:8) to account for how he will be able to speak knowledgably. See how you translated the similar expression there. Alternate translation: “I will be able to speak knowledgably because the Spirit of God made me; yes, it was the Almighty who breathed the breath of life into me”

## Job 33:5 (#1) (id: 271611)

**"array"** \- **"station yourself"**

Although they are used in other contexts as well, the words translated as **array** and **station** can have the sense of organizing troops into formations and placing them on a field of battle in order to defend a certain position. Elihu may be speaking as if Job’s words were troops that he wanted him to organize and as if Job himself were an army that should make a stand on a battlefield. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “marshal your arguments … draw up your defense” or “organize what you want to say … prepare to defend yourself”

## Job 33:6 (#1) (id: 271613)

**"I am for God according to your mouth"**

Elihu could be using the term **mouth** to mean: (1\) what Job said when he wished that God would respond to him. Job said something like this in [31:35](https://ref.ly/Job31:35) and in several other places earlier in his speeches. Alternate translation: “I will reply to you on behalf of God, as you wished” (2\) Job himself. Elihu would be using part of Job, the part he has been using to pursue his case against God, to mean all of Job. If you follow this second interpretation in your translation, you may wish to put the sentence break at the end of the verse rather than in the middle of the verse, since the two halves of the verse would be parallel statements. Alternate translation: “I am just like you to God”

**"I too have been formed from clay"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God formed me too from clay”

## Job 33:6 (#3) (id: 271615)

**"I too have been formed from clay"**

Elihu is speaking as if God had literally **formed** him from **clay**. He is indicating that he is only a mortal human being by alluding to the way that God originally formed humans from the dust of the earth. The Bible presents this concept in [Genesis 2:7](https://ref.ly/Gen2:7)). As the next verse makes clear, Elihu is reassuring Job that he does not have to be afraid of how he will respond to him, in contrast with the way Job said in [30:21–23](https://ref.ly/Job30:21-Job30:23) and other places that he was afraid that God would respond to him violently and with great force. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am only a mortal human being”

**"and my pressure will not be heavy on you"**

Elihu is speaking as if he might literally use his arms and hands to push down hard on Job and keep him from getting up, although he says that he will not do that. He means that he will not treat Job severely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will not treat you severely”

## Job 33:9 (#1) (id: 271620)

**""I {am} pure, without transgression;"**

In this verse and the next two verses, Elihu is telling what he heard Job say. You may wish to indicate that with an introductory phrase. While Elihu quotes many words and phrases directly from Job’s speeches (for example, Job described his prayer as “pure” in [16:17](https://ref.ly/Job16:17)), this is a general summary, not a series of exact quotations. Nevertheless, you may wish to present verses 9–11 as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “You have said, ‘I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, and I have no iniquity”

For example, Job asked God in [13:24](https://ref.ly/Job13:24) why God considered him an enemy. If you decided to translate the previous verse as an indirect quotation, you can continue to do that here.

**""He puts my feet in shackles;"**

Job spoke as if God had literally put his **feet** in **shackles** and as if his courses of action were literally **paths** that he was walking along. If you chose to express the ideas behind these images rather than the images themselves in [13:27](https://ref.ly/Job13:27), you can do the same thing here so that it will be clear that Elihu is quoting what Job said there.

**"in} this"**

By **this**, Elihu seems to mean Job’s belief that God was not treating him fairly, which Elihu has just summarized. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in thinking that God is not treating you fairly,”

**""in} this you are not right."**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could move this phrase to the start of the verse (after **Behold**), since it gives the reason why Elihu says that Job is **not right**. Alternate translation: “since God is greater than man, you have misunderstood how he is treating you”

## Job 33:12 (#3) (id: 271627)

**"than man"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

## Job 33:13 (#1) (id: 271628)

**""Why do you contend against him,"**

Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not contend against him, that he does not answer any of one’s words”

**"that he does not answer any of one’s words"**

Elihu could be saying: (1\) that Job’s complaint is that God has not responded to his questions and protests. In that case, Elihu would be using the term translated **words** to mean what Job has been saying. Alternate translation: “that he does not respond when one speaks to him” (2\) that God does not given an account for his own actions. The term translated **words** can also describe the matters with which someone is concerned or the things that someone does.

**"that he does not answer any of one’s words"**

Since Elihu is speaking to Job and he probably means that Job is complaining that God is not answering him, you could translate this in the second person if that would be more natural in your language.

## Job 33:14 (#1) (id: 271632)

**"God speaks once—yes, twice"**

As Eliphaz did in [5:19](https://ref.ly/Job5:19), here Elihu is naming a number that should be sufficient to illustrate his point and then increasing that number by one for emphasis. This was a common device in Hebrew poetry. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “God indeed speaks to people”

**""In a dream, in a vision of the night,"**

Elihu is using two of the same phrases that Eliphaz used in [4:13](https://ref.ly/Job4:13) in order to make a very similar point. The implication is that Elihu believes that Eliphaz was right to say what he did. Since Elihu is echoing Eliphaz implicitly, it would probably not be appropriate to add an explicit phrase to the text saying something like “as Eliphaz said,” but it may be helpful to translate the phrases here the same way you did in [4:13](https://ref.ly/Job4:13).

**"in slumbers"**

Elihu is using the plural form **slumbers** in a context where the singular term “slumber” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis.

This could mean: (1\) that the angel would **declare** to a person how he would need to change his actions so that he would be upright or have a right standing with God (**his** would refer to the person) or so that his actions would conform to God’s **uprightness** (**his** would refer to God). Alternate translation: “to declare to a person how he needs to change his actions in order to become upright” (2\) that the angel would **declare** to God on behalf of a person (the word translated **to** would mean “for”) that the person was upright or had the potential to change his actions and become upright and so did not need to die. Alternate translation: “to declare to God on a person’s behalf that he is upright”

**"I have found a ransom"**

The word **found** does not mean that God did not know where this **ransom** was and had to look for it and finally found it. Rather, it means that when the suffering person repented, this was a consideration that helped provide grounds for sparing him. (See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have recognized a good reason to spare him”

This person is using the term **light** by association to mean life on earth. As in many other places in the book, here the realm of the living is described as a place of light, by contrast with the realm of the dead, which is a place of darkness.

## Job - Chapter 34 Introduction (id: 718663)

Job 34 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks first to Job’s friends and others who may be listening, then from verse 16 onward he addresses Job directly, and then he speaks again to the others about Job starting in verse 34\.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Elihu speaking harshly about Job

It may be puzzling to your readers that while Elihu promises Job in 33:7 that he will be gentle with him, in this chapter, in verses 7–8 and 35, Elihu speaks very harshly about Job. However, this is really a matter of interpretation rather than translation, so it is not necessary to offer an explanation within the text of your translation.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Elihu quoting Job and his friends

In several places in this chapter, Elihu directly quotes Job or his friends. He does this to affirm what the friends said and to challenge what Job said. To help your readers appreciate that Elihu is doing this, you may wish to translate his expressions the same way you translated them when Job or his friends used them. In 34:3, Elihu quotes what Job said in 12:11\. In 34:5, Elihu quotes what Job said in 27:2\. In 34:6, Elihu quotes what Job said in 6:4, 16:13, and 27:4\. In 34:7, Elihu quotes what Eliphaz said in 15:16\. In 34:12, Elihu quotes what Bildad said in 8:3\.

### “man” and “men” with generic meaning

In several places in this chapter, Elihu uses the words “man” and “men” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Notes suggest ways in which you might do this. (See: When Masculine Words Include Women.)

### “For” at the start of a verse introducing a reason

Several times in this chapter, Elihu says “For” at the beginning of a verse to introduce the reason for something he said in the previous verse. Elihu does this in verses 3, 5, 9, 11, 21, and 37\. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could refer back more explicitly to the previous verse in order to show what Elihu is doing. The UST models ways to do this in each case. (“For” at the beginning of verse 23 introduces a new consideration, as the UST also illustrates.) (See: Connecting Words and Phrases.)

* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: `33276@UWTranslationManual`); Connecting Words and Phrases (ID: `33335@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 34:1 (#1) (id: 271691)

**"And Elihu answered and said"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. In this case, Elihu said more things in light of what he had already said and thus, in a sense, in answer to them. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And Elihu said further, in light of what he had already said”

## Job 34:2 (#1) (id: 271692)

**"my words"**

Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have to say”

## Job 34:2 (#2) (id: 271693)

**"wise {ones"**

Elihu is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. (The ULT adds the word **ones** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “you who are wise”

See: Nominal Adjectives

* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 34:3 (#1) (id: 271694)

**""the ear tests words,"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Elihu is using the same phrase that Job used to tell his friends in [12:11](https://ref.ly/Job12:11) that he had considered and rejected their perspective. Elihu is quoting Job in order to tell him that, for his part, he has considered Job’s perspective and rejected it. To help your readers recognize this, you may wish to use the same language in your translation here as you did in [12:11](https://ref.ly/Job12:11).

## Job 34:3 (#2) (id: 271695)

**""the ear tests words,"**

Elihu is using the word **and** to indicate that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “the ear tests words, just as the palate tastes food”

## Job 34:3 (#3) (id: 271696)

**""the ear tests words,"**

Elihu is speaking of the **ear** as if it could **test words** by itself. He is using the ear to represent hearing, and he means that people themselves test or consider the words of others when they hear them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “people consider others’ words when they hear them, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”

**""the ear tests words,"**

Though Elihu is making a general statement, he is referring implicitly to what Job has said and what he has decided about it. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have heard what Job has said and I have considered it and decided that it is not true, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”

**""Let us choose justice for ourselves;"**

Elihu is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and to the “wise ones” whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (Even though Job is present and listening, Elihu is not addressing him, so Elihu is still saying **us** to include everyone whom he actually is addressing.)

**"hear"** \- **"listen"**

The imperatives **hear** and **listen** are singular because Elihu is now addressing Job directly.

So use singular imperative forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Job - Chapter 35 Introduction (id: 718664)

Job 35 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks primarily to Job, although in the last verse he speaks about Job to the others who are present.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Does God not benefit when humans do what is right?

In verses 6–8, Elihu tells Job that whether he is good or bad has no effect on God; that only affects other people. Elihu probably means that God does not owe Job anything for being good and that God does not have to defend himself against Job being bad. But if what Elihu says is taken in a general sense, then it does not express the full teaching of the Bible. Elsewhere the Bible says that God is delighted when people obey him and that God grieves when people sin, knowing the destructive effects that this will have. God is glorified when people acknowledge that humans flourish when they obey his commandments. Elihu, like Job’s friends, says things that are true to a certain extent but that do not fully express the counsel of God as found in the Bible as a whole.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### reference of “you” and “your”

Throughout this chapter, Elihu uses the pronouns “you” and “your” to address Job individually, so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In verse 3, in the quotation by Elihu, the pronoun “you” is also singular because Job is using it to address God.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 35:1

## Job 35:1 (#1) (id: 271792)

**"And Elihu answered and said"**

See how you translated the same expression in [34:1](https://ref.ly/Job34:1). Alternate translation: “And Elihu said further, in light of what he had already said”

## Job 35:2 (#1) (id: 271793)

**"Do you consider this to {be} justice"**

Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not consider this to be justice!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 35:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 35:2 (#2) (id: 271794)

**"Do you consider this to {be} justice"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is singular here and throughout the chapter because Elihu is addressing Job directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

**"You say, ‘I am more righteous than God"**

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You say that you are more righteous than God” or, since this is not a direct quote from Job, “You speak as if you are more righteous than God”

**"evil {ones"**

Elihu is using the adjective **evil** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The ULT adds the word **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “evil people”

**"God does not hear vanity"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **vanity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Here the word **vanity** describes a cry to God for help that is insincere.

**"he does not visit"**

As Job did in [31:14](https://ref.ly/Job31:14), here Elihu is using the term **visit** in a particular sense.

## Job - Chapter 36 Introduction (id: 718665)

Job 36 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks primarily to Job, although others are present and listening.

* Verses 1–21: Elihu says that God uses suffering to warn and correct people.
* Verses 22–23: Elihu describes how great God is, using a storm that is gathering and approaching to describe God’s great power.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### The difficulty of understanding verses 17–21

Verses 17–21 are very difficult to understand. Biblical scholars have offered a variety of explanations of what Elihu says in each verse. Published versions of the Bible differ significantly from one another in their renderings of this material. The ULT seeks to offer a consistent and reasonable translation of these verses. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in several places in the way that it translates these verses. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the readings that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT.

### singular “you” and “your”

The pronouns “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Elihu is addressing Job. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use singular forms in your translation.

### “hear” meaning “obey”

In verses 10, 11, and 12, Elihu uses the term “hear” in a specific sense to mean “obey.” You may wish to use the term “obey” in each instance in your translation.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 36:1

## Job 36:1 (#1) (id: 271837)

**"And Elihu continued and said"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **continued** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it to add more to what he had already said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And Elihu said further”

See: Hendiadys

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 36:1
* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 36:2 (#1) (id: 271838)

**"Be patient"** \- **"and I will show you"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative **Be patient** are singular here because in this chapter, Elihu is addressing Job directly. So if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation here and throughout the chapter.

## Job 36:2 (#2) (id: 271839)

**"and I will show you"**

Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and I will show you that God has not been punishing you unfairly”

## Job 36:2 (#3) (id: 271840)

**"there are} yet words to God"**

Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he wants to say further by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there are more things to say on behalf of God”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 36:3 (#1) (id: 271841)

**"I will carry my knowledge to from afar"**

Elihu is describing places that are **afar** off from the perspective of how far a person would have to travel to come from those places. That is why he speaks of the places as being **from afar** and why he speaks of going to those places as going **to from afar**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will carry my knowledge to distant places”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 36:3 (#2) (id: 271842)

**"I will carry my knowledge to from afar"**

Elihu is speaking as if his **knowledge** were an object that he could literally **carry** to distant places. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “I will show a wide knowledge of my subject” or “I will speak with comprehensive knowledge”

## Job 36:5 (#1) (id: 271850)

**"and he does not despise"**

Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He is probably responding to what Job said to God in [10:3](https://ref.ly/Job10:3), “you … despise the work of your hands.” If that would be clearer in your language, you can supply these words from the context, specifically from verse 2, where Elihu speaks of God as his “Maker.” Alternate translation: “and he does not despise any of the people whom he has made”

## Job 36:6 (#1) (id: 271853)

**"He does not keep the wicked alive"**

**"He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous"**

## Job 36:7 (#3) (id: 271859)

* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 36:7 (#4) (id: 271860)

**"from the righteous"**

Elihu is not referring to a specific **righteous** person. He means righteous people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form, particularly since Elihu uses plural forms in the rest of this verse. Alternate translation: “from righteous people”

## Job 36:8 (#1) (id: 271863)

**""But if {they are} bound in chains"**

The phrase **bound in chains** could mean: (1\) the same thing as **caught in cords of affliction**. Elihu may be using repetition to emphasize the idea that these phrases express. In that case, he would be speaking in both phrases as if righteous people were literally **bound** or **caught** by affliction in order to say that they were suffering from affliction. Alternate translation: “If they are bound in chains of affliction; yes, if they are caught in cords of affliction” (2\) being bound in actual **chains**. This would mean that people who had previously been righteous had unfortunately committed some crime and had been punished with imprisonment. In that case Elihu would be using **chains** in the first part of the verse to mean actual physical restraint and **cords** in the second part of the verse to represent sufferings. Alternate translation: “But if they are put in prison for some crime or if they are suffering from affliction”

## Job - Chapter 37 Introduction (id: 718666)

Job 37 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This is the conclusion of Elihu’s speech. Elihu continues to use the storm that is gathering and approaching to describe God’s great power. He concludes by telling Job that he should not expect to be able to speak with such a powerful God.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### singular “you” in verses 15–19

The pronoun “you” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular in verses 15–19 because Elihu is addressing Job. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use singular forms in your translation.

### The nature of the questions in verses 15–18

Elihu asks Job a series of questions in verses 15–18\. He may want Job to try to answer these questions so that Job will have to admit that he does not understand what God does. So these could be actual questions that Elihu is using to get information, specifically, these admissions from Job. Alternatively, Elihu may be using the question form for emphasis. A note to verse 15 suggests two possible ways in which you could translate the question there. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in verses 15–18\.

## Job 37:2 (#1) (id: 271955)

**"Hearing, hear"**

Elihu is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Oh, hear”

* **Associated Articles:** Reduplication (ID: `33308@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 37:2 (#2) (id: 271956)

**"hear"**

The implied “you” in the imperative **hear** is plural because Elihu is addressing Job, his three friends, and any others who may be present and listening. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

Elihu assumes that Job will understand that by **the north** he means the abode of God. In this culture, people believed that there was a divine residence in the northern regions of the earth. You could translate this with a general expression or with a term that your readers would recognize as describing the abode of God. Alternate translation: “From God’s abode” or “From heaven”

## Job 37:22 (#2) (id: 272035)

**"comes gold"**

Elihu is using the term **gold** by association to mean golden splendor, that is, the glory of God. He is actually speaking of God coming in glory. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God comes in his glory”

## Job 37:22 (#3) (id: 272036)

**"around God {is} awesome majesty"**

Elihu is drawing an implicit contrast between the brightness of the sun, which people cannot look at directly, and the infinitely greater brightness of God’s glory. You may wish to make this contrast explicit in your translation. The UST models one way to do that.

**"The Almighty, we do not find him"**

Job said in [23:3](https://ref.ly/Job23:3) that he wished he knew where to find God so that he could go to where God was. Here Elihu is implicitly responding to Job in his own words. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “So, Job, none of us are able to find God and go where he is”

## Job 37:23 (#3) (id: 272039)

**"and he does not oppress justice and an abundance of righteousness"**

Elihu is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of his intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he ensures that there is justice and an abundance of righteousness”

## Job 37:24 (#2) (id: 272042)

**"He does not regard any of the wise of heart"**

Elihu does not mean that God is not pleased when people become **wise**. He means that God would not show favoritism to a person who was particularly wise compared with other people, because compared with God’s infinite wisdom, all people have only a little wisdom You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “He does not respect any person more than he respects other people, no matter how wise that person might be by human standards”

## Job - Chapter 38 Introduction (id: 718667)

Job 38 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the beginning of Yahweh’s response to Job. His response continues through chapter 41\.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

In this chapter, Yahweh begins asking Job a series of questions in order to show that Job does not understand the workings of the created world. Yahweh asks questions about the earth in verses 4–20, with a summary challenge to Job in verse 21\. Yahweh then asks questions about the sky in verses 22–38\. He starts asking questions about animals and birds in verse 39; this part of his speech continues into the next chapter.

The implication is that if Job does not understand and cannot explain how God makes things work in the visible creation, he certainly does not understand and cannot explain what God is doing as he works in unseen, mysterious ways to accomplish his purposes in the lives of people and over the course of human history.

When God comes to Job in the storm and responds to his questions, it becomes obvious that Elihu was wrong to say that God would not meet with Job. This shows God’s generosity to Job in granting him an interview as he requested, even though in the interview, God has to humble Job by demonstrating how little he actually knows.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Yahweh’s description of the creation

In this chapter, Yahweh describes the earth, sea, and sky according to the way the people of Job’s culture understood them. For example, in verse 16 Yahweh speaks of “springs” at the bottom of the sea that provide it with water. In verse 22, he speaks of “storehouses” in the sky where snow and hail are kept. In some parts of the chapter, these references occur within poetic images, such as the image in verses 4–6 of the earth as a building with “foundations” or the image in verses 12–13 of the dawn grasping the “edges” of the earth and shaking it. But in other places, the references do not occur within poetic images. In such places, Yahweh’s questions to Job, which demonstrate the limits of Job’s knowledge, depend for their force on these features being real, even though they do not correspond to the creation as we would describe it today. We may consider that Yahweh is using terminology that Job and the others who are listening would understand in order to communicate moral and spiritual insights to them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate these descriptions of the natural world from an ancient perspective with equivalent expressions that use terms that reflect your own culture’s perspective. Notes suggest how you might do this in various places. For example, a note to verse 16 suggests speaking of the “bottom of the sea” rather than of the “springs of the sea.”

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### The nature of the questions in verses 4–41

Yawheh asks Job a series of questions in verses 4–41\. He may want Job to try to answer these questions so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. So these could be actual questions that Yahweh is using to get information, specifically, the information from Job that he does not know the answers. Alternatively, Yahweh may be using the question form for emphasis. A note to verse 4 suggests two possible ways in which you could translate the question there. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in this chapter.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:1

## Job 38:1 (#1) (id: 272045)

**"And Yahweh answered Job from the storm and said"**

The narrator is using the word translated **And** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for making a transition from what has already been happening in a story and introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “And when the storm that Elihu had been watching and describing finally arrived where he and the others were, Yahweh answered Job from the storm and said”

See: Introduction of a New Event

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:1
* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: `33419@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:1 (#2) (id: 272046)

**"And Yahweh answered Job from the storm and said"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And from the storm Yahweh responded to Job”

* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:2 (#1) (id: 272047)

**""Who {is} this, darkening counsel"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis as he begins his reply to Job. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have been darkening counsel by words without knowledge!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:2 (#2) (id: 272048)

**"darkening counsel"**

Yahweh is speaking as if Job had literally been making **counsel** (that is, proper understanding) darker. He means that Job has been making the truth harder to understand. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “obscuring proper understanding”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:2 (#3) (id: 272049)

**"by words"**

Yahweh is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by speaking”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:2 (#4) (id: 272050)

**"without knowledge"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “without knowing what he is talking about”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:2
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:3 (#1) (id: 272051)

**"gird up your loins"**

Yahweh is speaking as if he literally wanted Job to **gird up** his **loins**, that is, to tuck the bottom of his robe into a belt so that he could move freely, as a soldier would do before going into battle. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “get ready for a difficult contest”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:3 (#2) (id: 272052)

**"like a man"**

Yahweh is using a particular word for **man** that can, in contexts such as this one, emphasize the strength and valor of a warrior. The point of this comparison is that Job should be brave, as a solider must be when going into battle. Yahweh is not using the term **man** to suggest that men are strong and that women are weak. Alternate translation: “like a brave person” or “as a soldier would do when going into battle”

See: Simile

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:3
* **Associated Articles:** Simile (ID: `33314@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:3 (#3) (id: 272053)

**"and I will question you and you will inform me"**

Yahweh is answering Job with his own words. In [13:22](https://ref.ly/Job13:22), Job said to God (who was not visibly present at the time), “And call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and answer me.” Yahweh is telling Job that he will take the first option: He, Yahweh, will “call” (ask questions) and Job can respond. However, Yahweh says something slightly different than Job did. He says that Job can **inform** him. For emphasis, Yahweh is actually saying the opposite of what he means. He already knows everything, so he does not need Job to provide him with information that he lacks. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Yahweh actually means. Alternate translation: “and I will question you and you can tell me what you think I do not already know”

## Job 38:4 (#1) (id: 272054)

**"Where were you in my founding of the earth"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this could mean: (1\) that Yahweh wants Job to try to answer this question and the questions in the rest of the chapter so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternate translation: “You were not there when I founded the earth, were you?” (2\) that Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You were not there when I founded the earth!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:4
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:4 (#2) (id: 272055)

**"in my founding of the earth"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the earth were literally a building and he had **founded** it, that is, laid a foundation for it (made a solid base on which to build it). Since this is poetry, you may wish to retain the image in your translation, using construction terms from your own culture, even if a speaker of your language would not ordinarily describe the creation of the world in this way. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when I cleared a space on which to build the earth” or “when I first started to create the earth”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:4 (#3) (id: 272056)

**"Declare"**

Yahweh assumes that Job will understand that by **Declare** he means that he wants Job to declare how the foundations of the earth were laid. You could indicate that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Explain how the foundations of the earth were laid” or “Explain how I first started to create the earth”

## Job 38:4 (#4) (id: 272057)

**"if you know understanding"**

It might seem that the expression **know understanding** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “if you know” or “if you understand”

**"Who set its measurements?"** \- **"Or who stretched a line over it"**

See how you translated the question in the previous verse, either as a question that Yahweh wanted Job to answer or one whose form Yahweh was using for emphasis. Translate the rest of the questions in the chapter in the same way that you decided to translate that one.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:5
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:5 (#2) (id: 272059)

**"If you know"**

Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Tell me, if you know”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 38:5
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: `33267@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:5 (#3) (id: 272060)

**"who stretched a line over it"**

By **line**, Yahweh means a measuring line, a long cord or rope with a standard length marked off at regular intervals. He is speaking as if someone had literally stretched such a cord over the earth to make sure that its **measurements** were exactly the ones that he had **set**. If your readers would not be familiar with what a measuring line is, if you wish to retain the poetic image in your translation, you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture. Alternatively, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “who measured it with a rod” or “who measured it to make sure that it had exactly the right dimensions”

## Job 38:6 (#1) (id: 272061)

**""On what were its foundations sunk?"**

Yahweh continues to speak as if the earth were literally a building. He here speaks as if he had **sunk** its **foundations** (that is, dug into the ground until he hit a solid surface on which to set them) and **laid its cornerstone**. As in verse 4, you may wish to retain the image in your translation, using construction terms from your own culture. Alternatively, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “How did I make sure that the earth would stay in place? How did I make sure that it would be strong and stable”

## Job 38:7 (#1) (id: 272062)

**""in the singing together of the stars of the morning,"**

It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. The phrase **the stars of the morning** could be describing: (1\) the stars at the time of their original creation. In that case, Yahweh would be speaking of the stars as if they were living things that had sung a joyful song to celebrate the glory and beauty of the creation, including that of the earth. You could retain the image in your translation, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “When I made the earth, it was in beautiful harmony with the stars” (2\) the angels, in parallel with the phrase **the sons of God** in the second half of the verse. Alternate translation: “When I made the earth, the angels sang a song of celebration”

**"and all the sons of God shouted"**

As in [1:6](https://ref.ly/Job1:6) and [2:1](https://ref.ly/Job2:1), the expression **sons of God** describes angelic beings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Job 38:8 (#1) (id: 272065)

**"And {who} enclosed the sea with doors"**

Yahweh is speaking as if he had literally used **doors** to keep the sea from flowing onto the land. The image is that the sea is behind a wall or dam and that these doors can be opened for flood\-control purposes but are ordinarily closed to contain the water. You could retain the image in your translation, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And who held the sea back with floodgates” or “And who restrained the sea from flowing onto the land”

## Job 38:8 (#4) (id: 272068)

**"in its issuing from the womb, {when} it came out"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the sea had literally been born and come out of the **womb** of its mother. You could retain the image in your translation, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when it was born” or “when I first made it a part of the creation”

## Job 38:9 (#1) (id: 272069)

**""in my making the cloud its clothing"**

Continuing the image of the sea being born when it was created, Yahweh is speaking as if he literally provided clouds as its **clothing** and **thick darkness** as its **swaddling bands** when it was first born. Within the context of this speech, this may be a reference to the way Yahweh has complete knowledge of and control over every element of creation. People in this culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos; these images may be an assertion that God has always had the sea under his control and care. Alternate translation: “when I sheltered it and protected it as a mother would do for her newborn child”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 38:9 (#2) (id: 272070)

**"in my making the cloud its clothing"**

Yahweh is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “when I made the clouds its clothing”

The term **swaddling bands** describes the strips of cloth in which mothers in some cultures wrap their newborn babies to help them feel secure. If your readers would not be familiar with what swaddling bands are, if you wish to retain the poetic image in your translation, you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture.

**"And I broke upon it my boundary"**

Yahweh may be referring implicitly to the way he **broke** off the edge of the land to make a **boundary** for the sea. This could be a description of the cliffs that serve as the boundary between the land and the sea in many places. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.

## Job 38:11 (#4) (id: 272078)

**"one has set"**

The pronoun **one** could be: (1\) an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “a boundary has been set” (2\) a pronoun that Yahweh is using to speak of himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “I have set a boundary”

Yahweh is continuing to speak of the **dawn** as if it were a living thing, in this case speaking as if the dawn could take **hold** of the **edges of the earth** and shake it to make **the wicked** fall off of it. This is a reference to the way, as Job said in [24:14–15](https://ref.ly/Job24:14-Job24:15), that criminals commit their crimes during the night, not during the day.

## Job 38:15 (#2) (id: 272094)

**"And"** \- **"their light is withheld"**

For emphasis, Yahweh is saying the opposite of what he means. As Job said in [24:16–17](https://ref.ly/Job24:16-Job24:17), for wicked people, day is like night (they stay at home and do not know what is going on outside) and night is like day (that is when they go out). So here Yahweh is speaking as if night were **light**, saying how wicked people see this from their perspective. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means, in your translation you could indicate what Yahweh actually means. Alternate translation: “And … their opportunity to go out and commit crimes is withheld”

**"to the breadths of the earth"**

Yahweh is using the plural form **breadths** in a context where the singular term “breadth” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis.

**"Where {is} this, the way {to where} light dwells"**

As a note to [9:9](https://ref.ly/Job9:9) explains, people in this culture believed that natural forces were kept in chambers or storerooms. Elihu said in [37:9](https://ref.ly/Job37:9) that the storm was coming from its “chamber.” Yahweh asks Job in verse 22 of this chapter whether he has seen the “storehouses” of the snow and hail. Here Yahweh is asking similarly whether Job knows how to get to the place where **light dwells**, that is, the place where he keeps light in order to have it available for use within creation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that uses terms that reflect your own culture’s understanding of creation. Alternate translation: “Do you know where the light of day goes when it is night”

**""that you would take it to its territory,"**

By **it** and **its**, Yahweh is referring specifically to darkness, which he mentioned in the latter part of the previous verse, but he is using darkness to mean both darkness and light. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use plural forms in your translation. Alternate translation: “that you would take them to their territories, and that you would perceive the paths of their houses”

**""that you would take it to its territory,"**

Job would need to **perceive** how to get to the **houses** of light and darkness before he could **take** them there, so it might be more natural to reverse the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “that you would perceive the paths of their houses and take them to their territories”

## Job 38:30 (#1) (id: 272131)

**""As {under} stone, the waters hide themselves,"**

Yahweh is describing further natural phenomena that, like the ice and frost he described in the previous verse, occur when it is cold. Yahweh is suggesting that if Job is as wise as he claims, he ought to be able to explain these as well. So this is implicitly a question. You could translate it that way if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Can you explain how, in cold weather, the waters hide themselves as under stone, and the face of the deep freezes?”

**"As {under} stone"**

The point of this comparison is that just as it is not possible to see through **stone**, it is typically not possible to see through the ice that forms on top of **the waters** in the winter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “As under stone through which one cannot see”

## Job - Chapter 39 Introduction (id: 718668)

Job 39 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is a continuation of Yahweh’s response to Job.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

In this chapter, Yahweh continues to ask Job questions that show that Job does not understand the workings of the created world. Yahweh began to ask Job questions about animals and birds in [38:39](https://ref.ly/Job38:39); he continues to do that in this chapter.

The implication continues to be that if Job does not understand and cannot explain how God makes things work in the visible creation, he certainly does not understand and cannot explain what God is doing as he works in unseen, mysterious ways to accomplish his purposes in the lives of people and over the course of human history.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### The nature of Yahweh’s questions to Job

As in the previous chapter, Yahweh may want Job to try to answer the questions he is asking so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternatively, Yahweh may be using the question form for emphasis. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in this chapter.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 39:1

## Job 39:1 (#1) (id: 272165)

**"Do you know the time of the bearing of the goats of the rock"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this could mean: (1\) that Yahweh wants Job to try to answer this question and the questions in the rest of the chapter so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternate translation: “You do not know the time of the bearing of the goats of the rock, do you?” (2\) that Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You do not know the time of the bearing of the goats of the rock!”

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 39:1 (#2) (id: 272166)

**"the goats of the rock"**

Yahweh is using the term **rock** by association to identify these goats by where they live. Your language may have its own name for goats of this type that identifies them by where they live. If not, you could identify them with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “mountain goats” or “wild goats” or “goats that live among the rocks”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 39:1 (#3) (id: 272167)

**"Will you watch the fawning of the does"**

The implication of this question is that Job would have to know when female deer were going to bear their fawns in order to be there to **watch** them give birth. So this question means basically the same thing as the first question in the verse. You could indicate this meaning in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Would you know when the does were going to give birth to their fawns so that you could be there to watch”

**"they will fulfill"**

Yahweh is referring implicitly to the **number** of **months** that the does will **fulfill** or complete before they give birth to their fawns. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they will fulfill before giving birth”

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 39:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 39:4 (#1) (id: 272170)

**"Their sons"** \- **"to them"**

The pronouns **Their** and **them** are masculine, meaning that they refer to the fathers and mothers of these young deer. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Your language may similarly use masculine plural pronouns for a group of two or more subjects that includes both male and female individuals. If not, you could show the meaning by using an explanatory phrase. Alternate translation: “The sons of does and bucks … to their parents”

**"Their sons"**

Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that would include both male and female young deer. Some languages may have a general term for the offspring of deer that would convey this sense.

**"If {it is} a kind feather and plumage"**

The word translated **kind** is also the word for another type of bird called a “stork.” The stork was given that name because it was kind to its young. So it is possible that Yahweh is comparing the ostrich directly to the stork here. Many versions of the Bible translate this verse that way. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

## Job - Chapter 40 Introduction (id: 718669)

Job 40 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The ULT sets the lines of verses 1–2, 4–5, and 7–24 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.

* Verses 1–2: Yahweh challenges Job to respond to what he has said so far.
* Verses 3–5: Job replies that he has nothing to say in response.
* Verses 6–14 Yahweh tells Job that if he wishes to judge the world as he would do, he must display power and justice in subduing wicked people.
* Verses 15–24 Yahweh tells Job to consider a great creature named Behemoth.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Behemoth

To help Job continue to recognize that he occupies a small and insignificant place within creation, Yahweh describes the strength and power of one of his great creatures, Behemoth. While this animal was known in the time of Job, its exact identity is now uncertain. You may therefore wish to use the name Behemoth in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, rather than trying to specify a particular animal that Yahweh is describing. The UST models this approach.

Special Concepts in This Chapter
--------------------------------

### Justice

In verse 8, Yahweh asks Job whether he wishes to decide what is right. and then in the next verse, Yahweh asks Job whether he has great power. However, Yahweh is not suggesting that might makes right. Rather, he is asking Job whether he has the might to make things right, as he then describes in verses 10–14\. In verse 10, the terms ”majesty,“ ”greatness,“ ”glory,“ and ”splendor“ describe moral qualities, not simply power. See if you have terms available in your language that can convey this meaning in your translation.

## Job 40:2 (#1) (id: 272245)

**""Is} a reprover to contend with the Almighty?"**

The Almighty is speaking about himself in the third person, and though he is addressing Job directly, he is also speaking about him in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could have the Almighty speak of himself in the first person and of Job in the second person. Alternate translation: “You said you wanted to reprove me, the Almighty; do you still wish to contend with me? You said you wanted to correct me, God; if so, then you must answer it”

## Job 40:2 (#2) (id: 272246)

**"The one correcting God, let him answer it"**

God is using the pronoun **it** to refer to everything he has just said to Job. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “If you still think you can correct me, then respond to everything I have just said to you”

## Job 40:3 (#1) (id: 272247)

**"And Job answered Yahweh and said"**

Here the narrator expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And Job responded to Yahweh”

* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 40:4 (#1) (id: 272248)

**"how shall I answer you"**

Job is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I am not able to answer you!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 40:4
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 40:4 (#2) (id: 272249)

**"I put my hand over my mouth"**

Putting his **hand** over his **mouth** was a symbolic action by which Job showed that he had nothing to say in response to Yahweh. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. You could also use an expression from your language and culture that has the same significance. Alternate translation: “I put my hand over my mouth so that I will not say anything” or “I bite my tongue”

## Job 40:5 (#1) (id: 272250)

**""I spoke once, but I will not answer,"**

As Eliphaz did in [5:19](https://ref.ly/Job5:19) and as Elihu did in [33:14](https://ref.ly/Job33:14) and [33:29](https://ref.ly/Job33:29), here Job is naming a number that should be sufficient to illustrate his point and then increasing that number by one for emphasis. This was a common device in Hebrew poetry, but if a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “Though I was insisting that you were wrong, I will not say that any longer”

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: `33299@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 40:5 (#2) (id: 272251)

**"but I will not answer"**

Job is implicitly using the term **answer** in the same sense that the narrator used it in verse 1 and in [34:1](https://ref.ly/Job34:1). That is, Job means that he will not say more things in light of what he has already said and thus, in a sense, in answer to them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but I will say nothing further”

**""Would you actually annul my judgment?"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations.

## Job 40:10 (#2) (id: 272264)

**""adorn yourself {in} majesty and greatness,"**

Yahweh is speaking as if he wanted Job literally to **adorn** and **clothe** himself with the qualities that he names. He means that Job ought to make it apparent that he has these qualities if he wishes to judge the world as Yahweh would do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “display your majesty and greatness; show your glory and splendor”

See: Metaphor

**""in} majesty and greatness,"**

The terms **majesty** and **greatness** mean similar things, and the terms **glory** and **splendor** also mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis.

## Job 40:11 (#1) (id: 272266)

**"Scatter the outbursts of your nose"**

Yahweh is speaking as if Job’s **outbursts** were objects that he could **Scatter**. Elihu used the same word for “scatter” in [37:11](https://ref.ly/Job37:11) to describe how God made lightning bolts go to various places, so the implication seems to be that Yahweh is challenging Job to direct his righteous anger against his enemies if he has the power to do that. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Direct your righteous anger against all your enemies”

## Job 40:13 (#3) (id: 272275)

**"cover their faces in the hidden {place"**

Yahweh is referring to a cultural practice. This could mean: (1\) the action of wrapping the head separately from the rest of the body when preparing a body for burial. Yahweh would be using this action to mean the entire act of burial, and this second part of the verse would mean the same thing as the first part of the verse. Alternate translation: “bury them in the hidden place” (2\) the symbolic action of covering the face of a person who was about to be executed. (There is an example of this in the Bible in [Esther 7:8](https://ref.ly/Esth7:8).) The face represented the person, and the fact that it could no longer be seen indicated that soon the person would no longer be alive. Yahweh would be using the covering of the face to mean the entire act of executing such criminals. Alternate translation: “execute them and put them in the hidden place”

## Job 40:16 (#1) (id: 272286)

**""Now behold, its strength {is} in his loins,"**

Yahweh is once again using the term **behold** to mean “consider.” In this instance, it may be natural in your language to translate these statements as exclamations that are calling for Job’s attention. Alternate translation: “What strength it has in its loins! What power it has in the muscles of its belly!”

## Job 40:17 (#1) (id: 272287)

**"It bends its tail like a cedar"**

The point of this comparison is that just as the branch of a **cedar** tree is flexible but strong, so this beast can raise its tail and hold it flexibly in the air. The ability to hold a tail upright, which older animals can no longer do, is a sign of youthful strength. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “It shows its vigor by holding up its tail as if that were a cedar branch”

**"Its bones {are} tubes of bronze"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the **bones** of this beast were literally **tubes of bronze**.

## Job - Chapter 41 Introduction (id: 718670)

Job 41 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter is the conclusion of Yahweh’s response to Job.

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Leviathan

In the previous chapter, to help Job recognize what a small and insignificant place he occupied within creation, Yahweh told him to consider a great creature named Behemoth. In this chapter, for the same purpose, Yahweh tells Job to consider another great creature that he calls Leviathan.

As the General Introduction to Job explains, ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean, which they called the “sea monster.” They also used the names Leviathan and Rahab to describe this creature. While it seems to have been known in the time of Job, its exact identity is uncertain today. And so it may be best to use the name Leviathan in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, rather than trying to specify a particular animal that Yahweh is describing. The UST models this approach.

### Yahweh answering Job with his own words

In several places in this chapter, Yahweh alludes to Job’s opening speech, in which Job cursed the day of his birth, by using the same language that Job did. In verse 10, Yahweh speaks of awakening Leviathan, as Job did in [3:8](https://ref.ly/Job3:8). In verse 18, Yahweh speaks of “the eyelids of the dawn,” meaning the first rays of the rising sun, as Job did in [3:9](https://ref.ly/Job3:9). In verse 30, Yahweh speaks of a “shard,” a piece of broken pottery, such as Job took to scrape his skin, as [2:8](https://ref.ly/Job2:8) describes. In each case, these are the only two occurrences of these words or phrases in the book. As Yahweh concludes his own speech, he is going all the way back to the beginnings of Job’s troubles and to the first concerns that he expressed in order to address everything that Job has said throughout the book. To help your readers appreciate what Yahweh is doing, you may wish to translate his expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier.

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 41:1

## Job 41:1 (#1) (id: 272311)

**""Will you draw out Leviathan with a hook?"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You cannot draw out Leviathan with a hook! No, you cannot tie its tongue with a rope!”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: `33310@UWTranslationManual`)

## Job 41:1 (#2) (id: 272312)

**"Will you draw out Leviathan"**

Yahweh now wants Job to consider another one of his great creatures, Leviathan. But he does not indicate this by saying, as he did for Behemoth in [40:15](https://ref.ly/Job40:15), “Now behold Leviathan.” Instead, he describes how difficult it would be to capture Leviathan, following upon his description of how difficult it would be to capture Behemoth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a natural way in your language to show that here Yahweh is introducing another creature that he wants Job to consider. The UST models this approach. Alternate translation: “Now I want you to consider another of my great creatures. Will you draw out Leviathan”

**"Will you draw out Leviathan"**

## Job 41:2 (#1) (id: 272316)

**""Will you put a rope into its nose,"**

Since someone would first have to capture Leviathan with a **hook** before restraining it with a **rope** in its **nose**, it may be more natural to put the information about the hook first. Alternate translation: “Will you capture it by hooking its jaw and then put a rope into its nose to restrain it?”

## Job - Chapter 42 Introduction (id: 718671)

Job 42 General Notes
====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The ULT sets the lines of verses 1–6 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.

* Verses 1–6: Job acknowledges that he did not have the knowledge and wisdom to challenge Yahweh’s government of the universe.
* Verses 7–17: The author describes how Yahweh restored Job’s health and prosperity and gave him a long life.

Special concepts in This chapter
--------------------------------

### Job’s repentance

This chapter describes how Yahweh blessed Job with health, prosperity, and a long life after he repented. However, Yahweh’s blessing was not dependent upon Job’s repentance. It was dependent upon Yahweh’s grace. (See: Justice, Restore, Bless and Repent and Grace)

* **Associated Passages:** JOB 42:1
* **Associated Articles:** Bless (ID: `26403@UWTranslationWords`); Grace (ID: `26658@UWTranslationWords`); Justice (ID: `26790@UWTranslationWords`); Repent (ID: `27028@UWTranslationWords`); Restore (ID: `27030@UWTranslationWords`)

## Job 42:2 (#1) (id: 272407)

**"and no plan is withheld from you"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one can thwart any of your plans”

## Job 42:3 (#1) (id: 272408)

**"Who is this, concealing counsel without knowledge"**

In the first sentence in this verse, Job is quoting what Yahweh said in [38:2](https://ref.ly/Job38:2), at the beginning of his speech. The ULT indicates this by putting the sentence in second\-level quotation marks. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You asked who this was who was concealing counsel without knowledge.”

## Job 42:3 (#2) (id: 272409)

**"Therefore"**

Job is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a conclusion that he has reached on the basis of what Yahweh said in his entire speech. Job is not using the word to introduce the reason why he has spoken without understanding. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Based on everything you have said, I now recognize that”

## Job 42:4 (#1) (id: 272410)

**""Listen, now, and I will speak;"**

In this verse, Job is once again quoting what Yahweh said in his speech. In [38:3](https://ref.ly/Job38:3) and [40:7](https://ref.ly/Job40:7), Yahweh said, “I will question you, and you will inform me.” Since Job had said in [13:22](https://ref.ly/Job13:22) that he could choose either to ask questions first or to listen to questions first, by saying that he would question Job, Yahweh was implicitly telling Job to listen, as Job indicates in the first part of this verse. The ULT indicates that Job is quoting Yahweh by putting this verse in second\-level quotation marks. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You told me to listen and you would speak; you said that you would question me and I would inform you”

## Job 42:5 (#1) (id: 272411)

**""With the hearing of my ear I had heard {about} you,"**

Job is using one part of himself, his **ear**, to mean all of him in the act of hearing. He is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Before this I had only heard about you, but now I have seen you for myself”

## Job 42:6 (#1) (id: 272412)

**"I despise"**

By the word **despise**, Job does not mean that he hates something. He means that he thinks little of something. He could mean: (1\) that he thinks little of himself, that is, he no longer believes that he can credibly declare whether God is treating anyone fairly or unfairly. Alternate translation: “I no longer believe that I understand as much as I thought I did” (2\) that he now thinks little of what he said in all of his speeches. Alternate translation: “I recognize that what I said was wrong”

## Job 42:6 (#2) (id: 272413)

**"in dust and ashes"**

In this culture, people would sprinkle **dust and ashes** on themselves as a symbolic action to show that they were greatly distressed. This is what Job’s friends were doing in [2:12](https://ref.ly/Job2:12) when they threw dust into the air so that it would land on their heads. Job was doing something similar in [2:8](https://ref.ly/Job2:8) when he sat down in a pile of ashes. Job could be sprinkling dust and ashes from the pile on himself as he speaks these words, or he could be speaking as if he were doing that in order to describe how sincerely he is repenting. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “by sprinkling dust and ashes on myself to show how distressed I am by what I did” or “very sincerely, as if I were sprinkling dust and ashes on myself to show how distressed I am by what I did”

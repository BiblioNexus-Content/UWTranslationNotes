## Matthew 1:8–9 (#1) (id: 217730)

**"and Joram fathered Ozias"** \- **"and Ozias fathered Jotham"**

In these two verses, Matthew lists **Joram**, **Ozias**, and **Jotham**. In the list of kings in 1 Chronicles 3, however, there are four names between **Joram** and **Jotham** (see [1 Chronicles 3:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:11-1Chr3:12)), not one. So, Matthew has not mentioned three of these kings, and the word translated **fathered** only requires the older person to be an ancestor of the younger person, who could be a son, grandson, great\-grandson, or even great\-great\-grandson. It is unclear exactly where in the list Matthew leaves out the three kings. He could be using the name **Ozias**: (1\) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Azariah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the great\-great\-grandson of **Joram** and the father of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: “and Joram was the great\-great\-grandfather of Ozias, and Ozias fathered Jotham” (2\) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Ahaziah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the son of **Joram** and the great\-great\-grandfather of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: “and Joram fathered Ozias, and Ozias was the great\-great\-grandfather of Jotham”

## Matthew 1:12 (#4) (id: 217742)

**"Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel"**

In [1 Chronicles 3:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:19), a brother of **Salathiel** named Pedaiah is listed as the father of **Zerubbabel**. However, early Greek translations of [1 Chronicles 3:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:19) list **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubabbel**. Matthew most likely used a source like these early Greek translations, so he probably intended his readers to think of **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubbabel** and not as his uncle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of this information in a footnote.

**"from Abraham until David {were} 14 generations, and from David until the Babylonian deportation {were} 14 generations, and from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ {were} 14 generations"**

In order to count 14 generations **from Abraham until David**, both Abraham and David need to be included. To count 14 generations **from David until the Babylonian deportation**, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations **from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ**, both Jechoniah and Jesus need to be included. Consider how you might express the calculations so that they match with the list. Alternate translation: “from Abraham up to and including David were 14 generations, and after David and until the Babylonian deportation were 14 generations, and starting with the Babylonian deportation and counting up to and including the Christ were 14 generations”

**"her husband,"** \- **"to divorce her"**

As the previous verse shows (see [1:18](https://ref.ly/Matt1:18)), Mary and Joseph were not yet married. In their culture, however, being “engaged” was a promise to marry, so Matthew can refer to **Joseph** as Mary’s **husband**. He can also refer to breaking the engagement as divorce. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Matthew is referring to an engaged man breaking the engagement. Alternate translation: “her fiancé … to break the engagement with her”

You could use simile form, or if necessary, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “already it is as if the ax is set against the root of the trees.

**"whose winnowing fork {is} in his hand, and he will thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire"**

In this verse, John describes the one who comes after him as a farmer who separates the useful grains of wheat from the other parts of the wheat plant by using a **winnowing fork** to **clear of his threshing floor**. Just as that farmer separates the grain from the chaff, so the one who comes after John will separate those who obey from those who do not. Just as that farmer saves the grain and burns up the chaff, so the one who comes after John will save those who obey and punish those who do not. If possible, preserve this metaphor. If necessary, you could use simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is like a farmer with a winnowing fork in his hand. He will separate those who obey God from those who do not, just as a farmer thoroughly clears off his fleshing floor.

Each of the three lines of poetry in this verse gives a different description of the same area. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including all three descriptions in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word or phrase that indicates that these lines are all descriptions of one place.

**""the people sitting in darkness"**

These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

**"certainly not"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

Here Jesus implies that the “judge” required the person to pay a fine or give money to the person who accused him or her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “until you have paid the last quadrans that the judge required”

## Matthew 5:26 (#5) (id: 218264)

**"the last quadrans"**

A **quadrans** was one of the smallest and least valuable coins in circulation in this place and time. It was equivalent to about an eighth of an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “the last penny” or “every bit of money that your creditor demands”

Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse.

**"But you"**

Here, the phrase **But you** introduces what Jesus wants each of his disciples to do in contrast to what the “hypocrites” do, which he described in the previous verse ([6:16](https://ref.ly/Matt6:16)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “As for you, however”

**"you, {"** \- **"your"** \- **"your"**

Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who is speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation.

**"anoint your head and wash your face"**

Here, to **anoint** the **head** and to **wash** the **face** is to take normal care of one’s self. Doing this gives the appearance that you are living life as normal. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use similar phrases that refer to normal bodily care, or you could use a general statement.

Here Jesus speaks of how people live as if they were walking on a **road** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow**, that means that it is difficult to go through and that not many people go through it. When a **gate** is **wide** and a **road** is **broad**, that means that they are easy to travel on or go through and that many people travel on or through them. Since these are important images that Jesus uses in the following verse as well, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “You should live like a traveler who enters through a narrow gate. Many people live like travelers who enter through a wide gate and travel on a broad road, but this path leads to destruction”

**"In the same way, every good tree produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces bad fruits"**

Here Jesus continues to speak of people as if they were plants that produced **fruits**. Just as a **good tree** produces **good fruits**, so people who follow God do what is right.

Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form.

**"which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk"**

Jesus is using the question form to show the scribes which of these things is easier to say. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. He could mean: (1\) that saying **Your sins have been forgiven** is **easier** than saying **Get up and walk**. This is because it is easy to show that someone is lying when they try to heal a paralytic, but it is not easy to show that someone is lying when they claim to forgive sins. Alternate translation: “it is easier to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ than to say, ‘Get up and walk.’” (2\) that both things are equally easy to say. Alternate translation: “saying ‘Your sins have been forgiven’ is just as easy as saying, ‘Get up and walk.’”

**"Gehenna"**

Here Jesus uses the name **Gehenna** to refer to hell. The valley named **Gehenna** was outside the city of Jerusalem and was a place where people threw out and burned garbage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated this name in [5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22).

**"for an assarion"**

An **assarion** was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “for a small copper coin” or “for half an hour’s wage”

## Matthew 10:42 (#6) (id: 219302)

**"certainly not"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

**"The blind see again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are being told the gospel"**

When he answers John’s disciples, Jesus lists many things that he has done. John’s disciples would have known that this list is similar to the lists found in [Isaiah 35:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa35:5-Isa35:6) and [61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1) that describe what will happen when God acts to help his people. Jesus does not directly quote either of these lists, but he wants John’s disciples to know that what he has done is what God promised would happen when the Messiah came. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a footnote that refers to the lists in Isaiah, or you could include a small amount of explanatory information. Alternate translation: “Just as God promised, the blind are seeing again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are being told the gospel”

**"A man dressed in soft clothing"**

Matthew assumes that readers will know that John wore crude, rugged clothing. Like his residence in the desert, his clothing was a symbolic protest against the established order. As such, it would have been offensive rather than attractive. So no one would have gone out just to see a person dressed that way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “A man wearing splendid clothing?

**""**

In these verses, Matthew quotes parts of [Isaiah 42:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa42:1-Isa42:4). He leaves out parts of [42:4](https://ref.ly/Isa42:4), and in many places his quotation does not match the Hebrew version of Isaiah. So, translate what Matthew writes, not what you might read in [Isaiah 42:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa42:1-Isa42:4).

**""He will not break a bruised reed;"**

These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

**"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, for the tree is known by its fruit"**

Here Jesus speaks of people as if they were trees that produced fruit. It makes sense to say that a tree and its fruit together are either **good** or **rotten**. It does not make sense to say that a tree is good and its fruit **rotten** or that a tree is **rotten** and its fruit **good**. That is because trees are **known** by their fruits. Similarly, people who follow God do what is right, and people who do not follow God do what is wrong. It does not make sense to say that someone who does what is right is not following God or that someone who does what is wrong is following God. Most likely, Jesus wishes to apply this figure of speech both to himself (a good tree) and to the Pharisees (bad trees). If possible, preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten. Similarly, either call people good and their deeds good, or call people bad and their deeds bad. For, just as a tree is known by its fruit, so people are known by their deeds”

Here Jesus refers to the person whom the demon formerly controlled as if he were a house that was **empty**, **swept out**, and **put in order**. This means that no one is living in the house, so it is ready for someone to move in. Similarly, the person is not serving or obeying anyone, so he is ready for someone to lead or control him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it finds the man like an empty house, having been swept out and put in order” or “it finds that the man is not serving anybody, but he is living a good life”

**"others"**

Jesus is using the adjective **others** as a noun to mean some of the rest of the seeds that did not fall beside the road or on rocky soil. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. See how you translated the word in [13:5](https://ref.ly/Matt13:5). Alternate translation: “some of the rest of the seeds”

**"certainly not"** \- **"certainly not"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words in the original Greek. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here.

If this would not be natural in your language, you could use second person forms in this verse.

Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

## Matthew 18:18 (#2) (id: 220797)

**"whatever you bind on the earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on the earth will be released in heaven"**

See how you translated the almost identical sentence in [16:19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:19). The only differences are that the words **you** and **whatever** throughout this verse are plural, and [16:19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:19) has the phrase “in the heavens” instead of the phrase **in heaven**. Express the idea as you did in [16:19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:19), but be sure to make any adjustments needed for the plural words and the phrase **in heaven**.

## Matthew 22:44 (#1) (id: 221636)

**"The Lord said to my Lord"**

Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance refers to God. The second instance refers to a person whom David respectfully calls “lord.” The ULT and UST capitalize this second instance of the word because it refers to the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “God, the Lord, said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord”

**"nor did anyone dare from that day to question him any longer"**

The words translated **nor** and **any longer** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “and people no longer dared from that day to question him”

**"And they tie up loads, heavy and difficult to carry, and they put {them} on the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing with their finger to move them"**

Here Jesus speaks as if the scribes and Pharisees were putting **loads** on people’s **shoulders** without doing anything to help with moving those loads. He means that they tell people many things to do, some of which are hard to do, but they do not do anything to help those people do the things that they require. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And they tell people many things that they need to do, which are like loads, heavy and difficult to carry, that they have tied up and put on the shoulders of these people. However, they are not willing to help these people do what what they have told them to do, as if they were not willing to move those loads with their finger” or “And they tell people many things that they need to do, but they are not willing to help these people do what what they have told them to do”\\n

Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

## Matthew 25:9 (#8) (id: 222113)

**"certainly not"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

**"this is my blood of the covenant"**

Here Jesus identifies the cup of wine as his **blood** of **the covenant**. This figure of speech has been interpreted in a number of ways. The wine could somehow become Jesus’ **blood**, or Jesus’ **blood** could be present in some way when people drink the wine, or the wine could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **blood**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible.

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here.

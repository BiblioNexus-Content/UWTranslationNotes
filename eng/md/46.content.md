## 1 Corinthians 1:1 (#1) (id: 240462)

**"Paul"**

In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul. I have been”

## 1 Corinthians 1:1 (#2) (id: 240463)

**"called {to be} an apostle of Christ Jesus"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on who is **called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “calling.” Alternate translation: “whom Christ Jesus called to be an apostle”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 Corinthians 1:1 (#3) (id: 240464)

**"by the will of God"**

Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the will** that **God** has. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind that this phrase refers to what God wills with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “because God desired this”

## 1 Corinthians 1:1 (#4) (id: 240465)

**"and Sosthenes"**

This phrase means that **Sosthenes** is with Paul, and Paul writes the letter for both of them. It does not mean that Sosthenes was the scribe who wrote the letter down. It also does not mean that Sosthenes dictated the letter with Paul, since Paul uses the first\-person singular more than the first\-person plural in the letter. If there is a way in your language to indicate that Paul writes on behalf of Sosthenes, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “and I write on behalf of Sosthenes”

## 1 Corinthians 1:2 (#1) (id: 240467)

**"to the church of God that is in Corinth"**

In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “This letter is for you who are members of the church of God at Corinth”

## 1 Corinthians 1:2 (#2) (id: 240468)

**"having been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **sanctified** and **called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “sanctifying” and “calling.” If you must state who does the actions, Paul implies that “God” does them. Alternate translation: “whom God has sanctified in Christ Jesus, and whom God has called to be saints”

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 Corinthians 1:2 (#3) (id: 240469)

**"in Christ Jesus"**

Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to Christ, could explain: (1\) the means by which God has sanctified the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “by means of your union with Christ Jesus” (2\) the reason why God has sanctified the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “because of your union with Christ Jesus”

**"in every place"**

Here Paul describes all believers as if they were **in every place**. He speaks this way to emphasize that believers can be found in many countries, towns, and villages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **in every place** to indicate that believers are found in many places around the world. Alternate translation: “in many places”

**"calling on the name of our Lord"**

The **calling on the name of** someone is an idiom that refers to worshiping and praying to that person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this phrase with a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “who pray to and venerate our Lord”

**"theirs and ours"**

In the phrase **theirs and ours**, Paul has left out words that may be needed in some languages to make a complete thought.

**"Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"**

After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for the Corinthians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language.

* **Associated Articles:** Blessings (ID: `33371@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 Corinthians 1:4 (#1) (id: 240474)

**"always"**

Here, **always** is an exaggeration that the Corinthians would have understood to emphasize how often Paul prays for the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **always** with a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Passages:** 1CO 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: `33281@UWTranslationManual`)

## 1 Corinthians 1:4 (#2) (id: 240475)

**"to my God"**

When Paul speaks of **my God**, he does not mean that this is a different **God** than the one the Corinthians believe in. Rather, he simply wishes to state that this **God** is his God. If **my God** in your translation sounds like it makes a distinction between Paul’s God and the Corinthians’ God, you could use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “to our God”

**"the one having been given"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Here Paul speaks as if the Corinthians had received a lot of money **in him**. With this language of being **rich**, Paul means that the Corinthians have received more than they need, and [1:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:7) shows that what they have received are spiritual blessings and gifts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **made rich** to: (1\) express this idea with a phrase that refers to how much God has given them.

**"the testimony of Christ has been confirmed"**

In this verse, Paul speaks as if what he told the Corinthians about Christ were testimony he gave as a witness in a court of law. This testimony has been **confirmed**, just as if other evidence proved to the judge that his **testimony** was accurate.

**"those of Chloe"**

Here, **those of Chloe** refers to people who are connected to Chloe and probably live in her house or work for her. Paul does not tell us whether they are family members, slaves, or employees. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of this phrase with a word or phrase that indicates that these people are related to or dependent on Chloe.

**"each of you says"**

Here Paul uses **each of you** to emphasize that many individuals within the Corinthian congregation are saying these kinds of things. He does not mean that each person says all four of these things. He also does not mean that every single person in the church is making these kinds of claims. Finally, he does not mean that these are the only four claims that they are making. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the form that Paul uses with an expression that singles out many individuals within a group, and you could add a phrase that indicates that these are examples of what they are saying. Alternate translation: “people in your group are saying things like”

**"Has Christ been divided"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **divided** rather than whoever does the “dividing.” If you must state who does the action, you can use a vague or indefinite subject.

## 1 Corinthians 1:13 (#4) (id: 240524)

**"Has Christ been divided"**

Here Paul speaks as if **Christ** could be **divided** into pieces and given to different groups. He speaks this way because he identifies the church with the body of Christ. If the church is divided into groups, then the body of Christ has been divided up as well. However, it is absurd to think that Christ’s body has been cut up into pieces, so it is also absurd to divide the church into pieces. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this connection more explicit. Alternate translation: “Has Christ’s own body been divided, just as your church has been divided?”

**"in the name of Paul"**

Here Paul uses the word **name** to refer to authority. What he means is that, when they were baptized, no one used the **name of Paul**, and therefore they do not belong to his group. Instead, he implicitly asserts that they belong to God, whose name would have been used when they were baptized. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the meaning of this word by using the word “authority” or by a phrase that includes the language of “belonging.” Alternate translation: “under the authority of Paul”

**"so that"**

Here, **so that** introduces a purpose or result. In this case, it introduces what results from Paul not baptizing many of the Corinthians. Because he did not baptize almost any of them, they cannot say that they were baptized into his name. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this connection with a word that indicates result, and you could specify that it is the result of Paul not baptizing many of them.

**"Where {is} the wise person? Where {is} the scholar? Where {is} the debater of this age"**

With these questions, Paul is not actually asking about the location of certain people. Rather, he is suggesting to the Corinthians that these kinds of people cannot be found. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind these questions with statements that: (1\) assert that these people do not actually have real wisdom, knowledge, or skill. Alternate translation: “The wise person does not really have wisdom. The scholar does not really know much. The debater of this age is not really good at arguing” (2\) assert that these people do not exist. Alternate translation: “There is no wise person. There is no scholar. There is no debater of this age”

**"the wise person?"** \- **"the scholar?"** \- **"the debater"**

Paul uses these singular nouns to identify types of people, but he does not mean just one **wise person**, **scholar**, or **debater**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this form with a form that identifies a type of person, or you could translate these nouns in plural form.

Paul uses the third person to speak about those whom God has called, because he is speaking of the group as a category in comparison with Jews who find the gospel a stumbling block and Gentiles who find the gospel to be foolish.

**"the foolishness of God"** \- **"the weakness of God"**

Paul describes God as having **foolishness** and **weakness**. He does not actually think that God is weak and foolish, but he is speaking of them from the perspective of the world and its wisdom. From the perspective of the world, Paul’s God is indeed foolish and weak. What Paul means to say is that what the world sees as **foolishness** and **weakness** is still **wiser** and **stronger** than anything that humans have to offer.

**"the wise,"** \- **"the strong"**

Paul uses the adjective **wise** to describe a group of people, and he uses the adjective **strong** to describe a group of people and things. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these two adjectives with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are wise … people and things which are strong”

**"God chose"** \- **"of the world, {"** \- **"in order that"**

In this verse, Paul repeats many of the words from the parallel parts of the previous verse. He does this because, in his culture, repeating the same idea with different examples was more convincing than using just one example. If possible, translate these words the same way that you translated them in [1:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:27). You could remove or change some of the words if it makes the sentence sound more convincing. Alternate translation: “he chose … of the world … in order that”

**"the base things"**

Here, **base things** is the opposite of the word translated “of noble birth” in [1:26](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:26). Paul uses it to refer to things and people that were not considered important or powerful in his culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **base things** with a word or phrase that refers to people and things that have low status or low importance.

**"the despised things"**

While **base things** refers to a person’s status or a thing’s status, the word translated **despised things** refers to how people treat other people or things that have low status. Usually, people badly treat others whom they consider to be of lower status, ignoring them or mocking them. That is what Paul means when he says **despised**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **despised things** with a word or phrase that refers to how people mistreat others of lower status.

As in [1:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:27), he uses the possessive form to clarify that **base things and the despised things** are only **base** and **despised** from the perspective of the world.

When Paul says that Jesus **was made for us wisdom** and **righteousness, and also sanctification and redemption**, he does not mean that Jesus has become these abstract ideas. Instead, he means that Jesus is the source of **wisdom**, **righteousness**, **sanctification**, and **redemption** for **us** who are **in Christ Jesus**.

So also, the Spirit of God is the only one that knows the things of God”

**"among men"** \- **"of a man"** \- **"of the man {that is} within him"**

Although the words translated **men**, **man**, and **him** are masculine, Paul is using them to refer to anyone, whether man or woman.

**"who among men"**

The phrase **who among men** is a way of asking about people or things that belong to a specific category. Paul means to ask if there are any **men** who can know **the things of a man**. He uses this phrase because God also **knows the things of a man**, so he must limit his question to only **men**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this form by using a phrase that asks about people or things, but only those that belong in a specific category. Alternate translation: “which man” or “out of all men, who”

**"the things of a man"** \- **"the things of God"**

Here Paul uses the phrases **the things of a man** and **the things of God** to refer to everything that makes up the person, including personality, thoughts, actions, desires, possessions, and many more similar categories. Paul is intentionally general and does not narrow down which of these categories he has in mind.

**"the spirit of the man {that is} within him"**

Here, the word translated **spirit** is the same word that Paul uses for the Holy **Spirit**. It refers to the interior life of a person, to the part of them that people cannot see, including their thoughts and desires. If possible, use the same word here that you will use later in the verse for the **Spirit**, since Paul is drawing an analogy between the human **spirit** and God’s **Spirit**. If you cannot use the word for God’s **Spirit** to describe a human being, you could: (1\) refer simply to a human without specifying which part of the human **knows**. Alternate translation: “the man himself” (2\) use an expression that refers to the interior life of a human. Alternate translation: “the consciousness of the man that is within him”

**"the spirit of the man {that is} within him"**

In this culture, people would speak of the nonphysical part of a human being as if it were inside the physical part of a human being. Here Paul speaks in this way when he says that the **spirit of the man** is **within him**. By using **within him**, Paul is identifying the **spirit** as the one that belongs to **the man**. It is not some other man’s **spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **within him** by: (1\) using a word or phrase that identifies that the **spirit** belongs to **the man** only. Alternate translation: “that man’s own spirit” (2\) expressing the idea by using a phrase that describes where a human being’s nonphysical part would be in your culture.

By calling the Corinthians **infants in Christ**, he means that in their relationship with Jesus, they are immature, have little knowledge, and are unable to understand very much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express why Paul calls the Corinthians **infants** with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to beginners in Christ” or “to those who could understand very little about their faith in Christ”

**"in Christ"**

Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains in what area of their lives they were like **infants**. They acted like **infants** in their relationship with Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind **in Christ**by referring to their “faith” in **Christ** or their “relationship” with **Christ**.

Here Paul uses these questions to do two things. First, the questions imply that **Apollos** and **Paul** are not very important. Therefore, an implied answer to these questions would be that **Apollos** and **Paul** are “not very much.” Second, Paul uses the questions to introduce his own answer to these questions. After using the questions to imply that he and **Apollos** are not much, he then states that they are **servants**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind these questions as a statement about the status of **Apollos** and **Paul** as **servants**, and you could use a word such as “only” or “merely” to express the idea that they are not very important.

The point is that what he did and what **Apollos** did are at the same level of importance, but God’s work is the most important. Another way to understand this contrast is to notice that Paul and **Apollos** assist in the process of plants growing, but **God** is the only one who actually makes them grow. Again, the main point is that Paul and **Apollos** are simply “servants” of God ([3:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:5)) in a process that God oversees.

If you need to state what is planted and watered, you could include a general word or words such as “seed,” “plant,” or “crop.” Alternate translation: “the one who plants the seeds … the one who waters the plants” or “the one who plants the crop … the one who waters it”

By calling the Corinthians a **God’s field**, Paul means to say that they belong to God and that they are the people among whom those who proclaim the gospel labor.

By speaking in this way, he means that he is the one who first introduced the Corinthian believers to the gospel, just like a **master builder** first lays **a foundation**. He then speaks of people who build **{on}** that foundation, meaning that others who proclaim more about the gospel can only do this by using and continuing from the good news that Paul already proclaimed.

He speaks in this way to remind them that only one person can introduce them to the gospel, and anyone who tries to introduce them to another gospel is building a different house, not the same house. Paul then directly states that the **foundation** refers to the message about **Jesus Christ** that he preached to them and which should be the starting point and basis for everything else they learn about the gospel.

**"if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw"**

Here Paul continues the metaphor about building a house. He compares those who teach about the gospel with builders who construct a house on its foundation. These builders can use a variety of different materials to construct the house, and Paul lists six. The first three, **gold, silver, precious stones**, are more durable, while the last three, **wood, hay, or straw**, are less durable. It is clear that Paul is interested in durability, because of the next verse, where he states that all of these materials will be tested with fire ([3:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13)). By speaking this way, he indicates that those who proclaim more about the gospel can teach things that are more or less true and acceptable to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “if anyone teaches you more about the gospel with words that are acceptable to God or words that are not acceptable to God”

He speaks as if **the day** of God’s judgment is like a fire that **will test** the building and show what kind of building materials the builders used.

**"Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God lives in you"**

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information or for agreement or disagreement. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing by reminding them of something that they should already know. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this question with an emphatic statement.

## 1 Corinthians 3:16 (#2) (id: 240841)

**"Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God lives in you"**

Here Paul develops the metaphor about constructing a building in new ways. First, he says that the Corinthians together are **a temple of God**, which is a specific type of building. The **temple of God** was the place where God was present in a special way. Paul is thus identifying the Corinthians as people among whom God is present in the same kind of special way. Second, he says that the Corinthians together are the house or city in which the **Spirit of God lives**. The house or city in which someone lives is where they are always present. Paul is thus saying that the Holy Spirit is always present with the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of Paul’s metaphors with a comparable metaphor or express the idea in nonfigurative language. Alternate translation: “Do you not know that you are the sacred shrine where God dwells, and you are the country in which the Spirit of God has residency?” or “Do you not know that God is present among you, and the Spirit of God is always with you?”

**"If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy that {person}. For the temple of God is holy, which you are"**

Here Paul finishes the metaphor about the temple that he began in [3:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:16). He notes that, because God’s temple is **holy**, God will **destroy** anyone who **destroys** the temple. He then again repeats that the Corinthians **are** the temple. By speaking in this way, Paul wishes to remind everyone among the Corinthian believers that “destroying” the unity of the believers is like “destroying” the **temple**, and God will act in response to this like he would if someone “destroyed” his **temple**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “If anyone desecrates God’s sacred shrine, God will punish that person. For the sacred shrine is holy, and you are God’s sacred shrine” or “If anyone divides the place of God’s presence, God will punish that person. For wherever God’s presence can be found is holy, and you are the place where God’s presence can be found”

**"In this case"**

Here Paul uses the phrase **In this case** to introduce further information about what it means to be **stewards**.

The metaphor itself could: (1\) refer to a Roman gladiatorial contest. The apostles, then, would be **exhibited** in the arena as part of the **last** event. As those who are **sentenced to death**, they would then die in this last event. Alternate translation: “has exhibited us apostles in the last event of the gladiatorial games, in which we are destined to die” (2\) refer to a victory parade. The apostles, then, would be **exhibited** at the end of the parade, or **last**. As the **last** prisoners, they are **sentenced to death**, and will be killed soon after the parade ends. Alternate translation: “has exhibited us apostles at the end of the victory parade, in the place where prisoners who are sentenced to death march” (3\) be a figure of speech that your readers would misunderstand. If this is the case, you could express the idea in nonfigurative language. Alternate translation: “has chosen us apostles to be humiliated, and we are destined to die”

With these statements, Paul identifies what he and the other apostles are like from the perspective of this world. They are **fools**, **weak**, and **dishonored**. Paul does know that from God’s perspective they are actually “wise,” “strong,” and “honored.” However, he speaks from the perspective of this world to help the Corinthians change their thinking. Instead of wanting to be **wise**, **strong**, and **honored**, the Corinthians need to realize that following God will instead make them appear to this world as **fools**, **weak**, and **dishonored**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of these statements with a word or phrase that clarifies that they are spoken from a different perspective.

## 1 Corinthians 4:17 (#2) (id: 240977)

**"I sent"**

Sometimes, Paul uses the past tense **sent** with reference to the person who carries the letter to its destination. However, Paul later speaks of Timothy visiting them as only a possibility (See: [16:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:10)). Therefore, the visit to which Paul refers here could: (1\) have already happened by the time Paul is writing this letter. Timothy would be visiting the Corinthians while Paul is writing this letter, since Paul uses the future tense to refer to how Timothy **will remind** them of Paul’s ways. Alternate translation: “I have sent” (2\) be when Timothy brings the letter to them, at which time he **will remind** them of his ways. Alternate translation: “I am sending”

## 1 Corinthians 4:17 (#3) (id: 240978)

**"who is my beloved and faithful child"**

Here Paul speaks of **Timothy** as if he were his own **child**. This continues the metaphor about Paul as a spiritual father from [4:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:15). Paul is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves **Timothy** in the way a father loves his child. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or plainly. Alternate translation: “who is my beloved and faithful spiritual child” or “whom I love and who is faithful”

**"in the Lord"**

Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, identifies Timothy as someone who faithfully does what he is called to do in his union with **the Lord**.

**"my ways {that are} in"**

Here Paul speaks of how he lives and what he does as **my ways**, which refers to the paths that Paul walks on. This way of speaking is related to how Paul has already spoken of behavior as “walking” (See: [3:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:3)). The phrase **my ways** could identify: (1\) how Paul thinks and lives. Alternate translation: “the way that I live in” (2\) the principles that Paul follows concerning how to think and live. Alternate translation: “the principles that I follow in”

Here Paul does not explicitly state what it is that he is teaching. From the previous words, however, it is clear that he teaches his **ways**, the same **ways** that Timothy will **remind** them about.

**"the word"** \- **"their power"**

The contrast between **word** and **power** was well known in Paul’s culture. The contrast states that people can say many things, but they cannot always do what they say they can.

**"the kingdom of God {is} not in word but in power"**

Here Paul speaks as if **the kingdom of God** exists **in**, not **word**, but **power**. By this, he means that **the kingdom of God** does not consist in what people say but in what they do. To say it another way, **word**, or what people say, by itself does not make people part of God’s kingdom. Rather, it takes God’s **power** working for and through people to make them part of God’s kingdom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God consists not in word but in power” or “the kingdom of God is not about word but about power”

## 1 Corinthians 4:21 (#1) (id: 241002)

**"What do you want"**

Paul asks the Corinthians **What** they **want** because he wants them to realize that their behavior will show him how to respond to them. He does not want the Corinthians to tell him all their desires. Rather, he presents two options in the rest of the verse, and the question **What do you want?** shows the Corinthians that they can choose between those two options by listening to Paul or choosing not to listen to him. If your language does not use a question to express this idea, you can translate the question in statement form. Alternate translation: “Depending on what you do, I will behave towards you in one of two ways.” or “How you respond to me will tell me how to respond to you.”

**"Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and a spirit of gentleness"**

Here Paul uses a question to present the two options for how he could act toward the Corinthians when he “comes” to them. He asks a question for the same reason he asked the first question in this verse. He wants them to realize that how they choose to respond to him will dictate how he will act when he visits. If they do not listen to him, he will **come with a rod**. If they do listen, he will come **with love and a spirit of gentleness**. If your language does not use a question to express this idea, you can translate the question in statement form. Alternate translation: “I will either come to you with a rod or with love and a spirit of gentleness.” or “If you do not listen, I will come to you with a rod. If you do listen, I will come to you with love and a spirit of gentleness.”

## 1 Corinthians 4:21 (#4) (id: 241005)

**"with a rod"**

Paul speaks of coming **with a rod** as if he is going to physically beat the Corinthians to teach them to listen to him. This metaphor may continue the way in which he speaks of himself as a “father” in [4:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:14-1Cor4:15), since fathers could punish their children physically **with a rod** if they did not obey. By speaking in this way, Paul thus refers to discipline or punishment, but the discipline he threatens will not be physical. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a word or phrase that would describe discipline or punishment, or you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to punish you” or “with a harsh rebuke”

In Paul’s culture, **as spirit of** something is a way to describe a person’s attitude that is characterized by that thing. Here, then, Paul speaks about an attitude that is gentle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **spirit** with a word such as “attitude” to express the idea. Alternate translation: “an attitude”

If this information would not be implied in your language, you could include a word or phrase that indicates that Paul refers to the attitude of **Gentiles** towards this kind of **sexual immorality**.

Here, it is not clear whether the person (**someone**) marries **his father’s wife** or not. What is clear is that he is in a long\-term sexual relationship with **his father’s wife**.

In [5:6–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:6-1Cor5:8), Paul speaks about **yeast** and “dough.” Verses 7–8 clarify that Paul is thinking about the “Passover.” In this Jewish festival, people would remove all the **yeast** from their houses and only bake dough that was not fermented (“unleavened bread”). See [Exodus 12:1–28](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:28). In this verse, then, the **yeast** does not represent a good thing. Rather, it is supposed to be removed from the house, but any **yeast** that is left will still “leaven” a whole loaf. If your language would not consider **yeast** to be a bad thing when mixed into dough, you could include a word or phrase that indicates that the **yeast** is not wanted in the dough.

Here, **yeast** refers to anything that is added to bread dough to make it ferment and rise. This could be **yeast** itself or dough that is already fermented (“leaven”). Paul here uses this metaphor to indicate that, just like even a little bit of **yeast** will “leaven” **the whole loaf**, so a little bit of sin, or one person who sins, will affect the whole church. Therefore, the Corinthians believers should not “boast,” since the one person who is sinning among them denigrates the whole church. Since this metaphor is based on material from the Old Testament, you should try to preserve the form in your language. You could use a simile, or if necessary, you could use a comparable metaphor.

Just like in [5:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:6), he compares sin to **yeast**. By speaking in this way, he urges the Corinthians to **clean out** the person who is sinning. Then, they will be like **new dough**, like **unleavened bread**, that is, without sin. Since this metaphor is based on material from the Old Testament, you should try to preserve the form in your language. You could use a simile, or if necessary, you could use a comparable metaphor.

When God delivered the Jewish people from Egypt, he required them to sacrifice a lamb and spread its blood on their doors. God did not harm anyone who had the blood on their door, but the firstborn son of anyone who did not have the blood on their door died. Because of this, the **lamb** that was sacrificed at **Passover** represented God delivering the Jewish people by accepting the **lamb**’s death in place of the firstborn son. See [Exodus 12:1–28](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:28). The implication here is that **Christ**’s death also functioned in this way, in place of those whom he delivers.

He then identifies that the **yeast** stands for **evil and wickedness**, while the **unleavened bread** that they are supposed to eat stands for **sincerity and truth**.

Here, **to associate with** often refers to two groups of people meeting together. The idea here is that **sexually immoral people** should not be a part of the Corinthians’ group. If **to associate with** does not have this meaning in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that refers to including people in one’s group. Alternate translation: “to consistently meet with”

**"by no means"**

Paul uses **by no means** to strongly introduce a clarification about what he wrote to them previously ([5:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:9)). When he told them “not to associate with sexually immoral people,” he did not mean **people of this world**. Rather, as the next verse clarifies, he meant fellow believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **by no means** with a word or phrase that introduces a qualification to a previous statement. Alternate translation: “not that you should not associate at all with”

**"since then you would need to go out from the world"**

Here Paul draws the logical conclusion about what he did not mean in his letter. Thus, while Paul does not think that the basis for the exhortation is true, he does think that this is the logical result of that basis. He gives this exhortation to show that it is absurd, since they cannot **go out from the world**. Therefore, the basis for this exhortation is also absurd. If **since then** in your language would not introduce a result from a reason that Paul thinks is not true, you could use a word or phrase that would introduce such an idea. Alternate translation: “If that was what I had meant, then you would need to go out from the world”

**"to go out from the world"**

This phrase is not a euphemism for dying. Instead, Paul is saying that the Corinthians would need to travel off earth to get away from the **immoral people of this world**. In his culture and time, this was impossible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **go out from the world** with a word or phrase that refers to traveling off earth.

**"But now I wrote to you"**

Here Paul could be speaking about: (1\) the letter he is writing **now**, in contrast to the letter he already wrote ([5:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:9)). He uses the past tense **wrote** because the “writing” will be in the past when the letter is read to the Corinthians. Use the tense that would be appropriate in your language for this situation.

Paul did not require the Corinthians **not to associate** with those people, but he does require them **not to associate** with any such person **who is called a brother**.

**"so\-called"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **called** rather than the person doing the “calling.” If you must state who does the action, you can use “you” or “the brother” as the subject.

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. Here, the truthful answer to the question is “they are, but they should not.” Paul asks the question to get the Corinthians to realize how bad going **to court before the unrighteous** is.

Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are not **mastered** rather than focusing on **anything**, which tries to do the “mastering.” Alternate translation: “nothing will master me”

**"will not be mastered by"**

Here, **be mastered** refers to being under the authority of something else. Paul here means that some things, when a person habitually does them, begin to have power or control over that person. Here, then, he wishes to tell the Corinthians that, while such things might be **lawful**, they should avoid doing these things because they will **be mastered** by these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind **be mastered**by using words that refer to “power” or “control.” Alternate translation: “will not be controlled by” or “will not be under the power of”

**"Food {is} for the stomach, and the stomach for food,” but"**

In this verse, Paul quotes what some people in the Corinthian church are saying, just like he did in [6:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12). The ULT, by using quotation marks, indicates that this claim is a quotation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Food {is} for the stomach, and the stomach for food** and think that Paul is claiming this by clarifying that some of the Corinthians are saying this, and Paul is saying the words that occur after **but**.

Paul agrees with the Corinthians about **food** and **the stomach**, but he disagrees that **sexual immorality** and **the body** should be understood in the same way. Instead, **the body** exists **for the Lord**. Paul further explains in the next verse ([6:14](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:14)) that, unlike **food** and **the stomach**, God will not **do away with** the **body**, since we will be resurrected.

Here, **being joined to the prostitute** is a euphemism for having sex with a **prostitute**. Paul uses this euphemism in order to be polite. He also picks this specific euphemism because it can also refer to **being joined** to someone without sexual implications. He uses the phrase in this way in the next verse to speak about union with Christ ([6:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:17)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **being joined to the prostitute** with a similar polite euphemism in your language.

## 1 Corinthians 6:20 (#2) (id: 241209)

**"you were bought with a price"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **bought** rather than the person doing the “buying.” If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God bought you with a price”

**"for a man not to touch a woman"**

Here, **for a man** to **touch a woman** is a euphemism for having sex. This is a general statement about having sex, although Paul primarily speaks about sex within marriage in the verses that follow. The Corinthians used this euphemism in their letter to Paul in order to be polite. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **for a man not to touch a woman** with a similar polite euphemism in your language.

Here Paul uses two third\-person imperatives. If you have third\-person imperatives in your language, you could use them here.

The phrases **have his own wife** and **have her own husband** refer primarily to the ongoing state of being married, which includes continuing to have sex. However, the idiom primarily emphasizes remaining in a state of marriage with one’s current spouse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **have his own wife** and **have her own husband** with a comparable idiom or refer directly to staying married.

**"Let the husband give to the wife the duty"**

Here Paul uses **duty** to refer to married couples having sex. He uses this word to be polite and also because he wishes to emphasize that having sex is an obligation for married couples.

## 1 Corinthians 7:9 (#4) (id: 241259)

**"to burn"**

Here, **to burn** is a way to refer to sexual desire. Paul uses **burn** because he represents the desire as hard to fight and as something that consumes a person like fire consumes a building. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or by including a reference to sexual desire. Alternate translation: “to burn with desire” or “to lust after someone”

**"to the married"**

Paul is using the adjective **married** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate **married** with a noun phrase or a relative clause. Alternate translation: “to those who are married”

**"not I, but the Lord"**

Here Paul clarifies that he is not the authority behind this command. It is **the Lord** who is the authority here. Paul specifically has in mind what **the Lord** said about marriage and divorce while he was on earth (See: [Mark 10:5–12](https://ref.ly/Mark10:5-Mark10:12)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **not I, but the Lord** either by identifying that it is not Paul “alone” who gives the command, or by clarifying that Paul is referring to what **the Lord** said. Alternate translation: “not I alone, but the Lord also” or “and here I refer to what the Lord said”

**"a wife"** \- **"from her husband"**

Here Paul is speaking of wives and husbands in general, not just of one **wife** and **husband**.

**"is not to be separated from"**

**"is not to be separated"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on the **wife**, who is **separated**, rather than the person doing the “separating.” If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that the **wife** does it herself.

**"but even if she might be separated, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled to the husband"**

The ULT puts this clause in parentheses because it is a qualification of what Paul said in [7:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:11) and because one can read [7:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:10-1Cor7:11) smoothly together without this clause. In this clause, Paul issues commands about what the wife is supposed to do if she divorces her husband despite what Paul has said. Use a form in your language that would indicate a qualification or a parenthesis. Alternate translation: “if she is separated despite what I have said, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled to the husband”

Paul omits them because he already used them in [7:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:10) and he assumes his audience will infer them from there.

**"I, not the Lord"**

Here, **I, not the Lord** is the opposite of what Paul said in [7:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:10). Paul wishes to clarify that he is the authority behind this command. Of course, **the Lord** made him an apostle and gave him authority, but he wants the Corinthians to know that he is speaking out of that authority here, and he is not referring to what **the Lord** said while he was on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **I, not the Lord** either by identifying that it is Paul alone who gives the command, or by clarifying that **the Lord** did not say anything about this topic.

**"how do you know, woman, whether you will save the husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save the wife"**

Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer is “we do not know for sure.” If these questions would be confusing for your readers, you could express the ideas by using statements. Paul could be using these questions to show the Corinthians that: (1\) they should have little confidence about unbelieving spouses becoming Christians. The questions thus support how Paul allows divorces initiated by an unbelieving spouse in [7:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:15). Alternate translation: “you cannot know, woman, that you will save the husband. And you cannot know, man, that you will save the wife.” (2\) show the Corinthians that they should have much confidence about unbelieving spouses becoming Christians. The questions thus support how Paul says that the unbelieving spouse is “holy” in [7:14](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:14). Alternate translation: “you could not know, woman, but you may save the husband.

**"how do you know, woman, whether you will save the husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save the wife"**

Here Paul directly addresses a **woman** and a **man** in the audience. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean a **woman** or **man** in their group who was married to an unbelieving spouse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **woman** or **man** by stating the direct address in a different way. Alternate translation: “how does any woman know whether she will save the husband? Or how does any man know whether he will save the wife?”

Here Paul refers to **woman**, **husband**, **man**, and **wife** in the singular, but he is speaking generically of any person who fits into these categories. If your language does not use the singular form to refer to people in general, you can use a form that does refer generically to people in your language.

Paul acknowledges this exception but wishes to emphasize the main point: the believers should remain in the state they are in. If **However** would not have the meaning of acknowledging an exception to a claim, you could use a word or phrase that does do so. Alternate translation: “In every other case”

**"he was called"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “calling.” If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “God called him”

Instead, they should serve God in the situations in which God called them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind **remain with God in that** plainly or with a comparable metaphor.

**"is bound for"**

Here, **bound** refers to the legal and moral obligation to remain married. This obligation is strong enough that Paul can speak about it as if it were a rope that **bound** the man and the woman together.

## 1 Corinthians 8:1 (#2) (id: 241467)

**"the things sacrificed to idols"**

Here Paul speaks about animals that are slaughtered, offered to a god, and then eaten. For many people in Paul’s culture, this was the only meat that was available for them to eat. In many cases, people would eat this meat at a god’s temple or shrine. However, sometimes the meat could be sold to people, who would then eat it in their homes. In the next few chapters, Paul will speak about whether and how Christians should eat or not eat this meat. If your language has a specific word or phrase for meat from an animal that has been offered to a god, you could use it here. If your language does not have such a word, you can use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols”

It becomes clear in [8:4–6](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:4-1Cor8:6) that Paul is speaking about **knowledge** about other gods, specifically knowing that there is only one God and that other gods do not really exist. If possible, do not give further explanation of **knowledge** here, since Paul explains later in the chapter. If you must specify what the **knowledge** is about, you could clarify that it is about the **idols** or the topic of **things sacrificed to idols**.

Paul himself does not believe that what people call **gods** and **lords** really are those things; rather, [10:20–21](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:20-1Cor10:21) suggests that Paul thinks these **gods** and **lords** are actually demons.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea that **knowledge** is **not in** someone with a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “not everyone knows this”

Here Paul implies that their **authority** is over “food”, as mentioned in the last verse ([8:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:8)). The point is that food has no **authority** over believers, whether to make them more or less “near to God.” Instead, believers have **authority** over food and can thus eat whatever they want. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express what **authority** refers to here by clarifying that it refers to **authority** over “food.” Alternate translation: “this authority of yours over food” or “this authority of yours concerning eating”

## 1 Corinthians 8:13 (#6) (id: 241546)

**"certainly not"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In Paul’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would think that the two negatives form a positive, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as Paul’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you can translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

**"meat"**

Throughout this section, the “things sacrificed to idols” refers primarily to **meat**, and eating this kind of **meat** was one of the only ways for most people to eat **meat** at all. Paul here is stating that he will give up **meat** in general, whether it is sacrificed to idols or not. He implies that he does this so that fellow believers, who do not know whether the **meat** has been sacrificed to idols or not, will not stumble. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the implications here to make them explicit. Alternate translation: “meat, even if it has not been sacrificed to idols”

**"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord"**

Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to all of them is “yes.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these questions by stating the ideas with strong affirmations. Alternate translation: “I certainly am free. I certainly am an apostle. I have certainly seen Jesus our Lord. You are certainly my work in the Lord.”

**"free"**

Here, **free** could mean that Paul is **free** to: (1\) eat whatever he wants. This connects this question with chapter 8\. Alternate translation: “free to eat whatever I wish” (2\) receive financial support from the believers he serves. This connects this question with the first half of this chapter.

**"My defense to the ones examining me"**

Here Paul uses language that would normally be used in the legal courts. The **defense** is what the persons accused would say to prove their innocence. The ones **examining** are the ones who are in charge of the court and make the decisions about who is guilty and who is innocent. Paul uses this metaphor to explain that he is defending himself against people who have accused him of acting wrongly.

Paul intentionally does not state the “charge” against him, so leave it unstated if possible. If you must state what the “charge” against Paul is, you could clarify that it relates to whether he is truly an apostle or not. Alternate translation: “to those who examine me about my apostleship”

Paul is saying that he and Barnabas have **the right** to receive food and drink so that they can **eat** and **drink**.

**"the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas"**

Even though **Cephas** was one of the **apostles**, Paul mentions him separately to emphasize him as an example. He has already used **Cephas** as an example earlier in the letter (See: [1:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:12); [3:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:22)). Perhaps the Corinthians were comparing **Cephas** and Paul.

Paul already spoke about what he thinks is true: he and Barnabas do “have the right” to receive food and drink, and they “have the right” to travel with a wife. Here Paul gives the incorrect alternative: they alone do not **have the right not to work**. He introduces this incorrect alternate to show that his earlier statements must be true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Or** with a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Otherwise, would it not be true that only Barnabas and I do not have”

The questions assume that the answer to all of them is “no one.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these questions by stating the ideas with strong negations.

Paul uses the passive form here to focus on what **is written** rather than focusing on the person doing the “writing.” If you must state who does the action, you can express it so that: (1\) the scripture author writes or speaks the words. Alternate translation: “Moses has written in the law” (2\) God speaks the words. Alternate translation: “God has said in the law of Moses”

**"Do not muzzle an ox treading out grain"**

In Paul’s culture, farmers often would make **oxen** walk or “tread” on harvested wheat to separate the kernels of grain from the wheat stalks. Some people would **muzzle an ox** while it is **treading out grain** in order to keep the **ox** from eating the **grain**. The point of the command is that the **ox** should be allowed to eat what it is working to produce: the **grain**. If your readers would not understand what this command is about, you could include a footnote explaining the context or add a short clarifying phrase. Alternate translation: “Do not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating the grain it is treading out”

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing.

**"God does not care about the oxen, does he"**

Here Paul speaks as if God has no concern or interest in **oxen**. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that the primary intent of the command he quotes is not about caring for oxen but rather caring for something or someone else. He specifies what the primary intent of the command is in the next verse: it is **for our sake** ([9:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:9)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could soften Paul’s question so that it argues that the command is not “primarily” or “mostly” about **oxen**. If possible, however, maintain the strength of Paul’s statement, since he offers an explanation in the next verse. Alternate translation: “God does not mostly care about the oxen, does he”

In this verse, Paul applies the farming language he used in [9:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:9-1Cor9:10). When he and Barnabas “sow,” they should also “reap” the harvest. Paul clarifies that what they **sowed** was **spiritual things**, which means the good news. The **material things** that they can **reap** are money and support from the Corinthians. If your reader would misunderstand this application of the farming language, you could use analogies to clarify what Paul is referring to or express the idea plainly.

**"if"**

Paul is speaking as if “proclaiming” **the gospel** was only a possibility, but he means that he actually does this. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement.

**"compulsion is placed"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on himself, upon whom the **compulsion is placed**, rather than focusing on the person placing the **compulsion**. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “God places compulsion”

**"if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship"**

Here Paul uses **if** to introduce two possibilities. He means that he might **do this willingly**, or he might do it **unwillingly**. He specifies a result for each option, but he implies that he does it **unwillingly** (See: the “compulsion” in [9:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:16)).

**"But if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship"**

This sentence could: (1\) include both the “if” and the “then” statements and explain how Paul preaching the gospel is “unwilling.” He did not choose this **stewardship**, and so he does it **unwillingly**. However, the reason he does preach the gospel is because he has **been entrusted with** that **stewardship**. Alternate translation: “But if unwillingly, I do this because I have been entrusted with a stewardship” (2\) express the “if” statement for the question (the “then” statement) at the beginning of the next verse ([9:18](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:18)). The word **unwillingly** would modify **entrusted**, and you would need to connect the end of this verse and the beginning of the next verse with a comma, dropping the capitalization on “What.” Alternate translation: “But I have been unwillingly entrusted with a stewardship,”

**"the ones running in a stadium all run, but {only} one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you might obtain {it"**

Here Paul begins using athletic metaphors, metaphors he will use throughout [9:24–27](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:24-1Cor9:27). In this verse, he focuses on footraces. In his culture, only the runner who finished first would receive **the prize**. The **prize** might be one of many things, but often it was a “wreath” of leaves (See: [9:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:25)). Paul’s point is that the runner who wished to win had to work and train hard to be the best. Paul wants the Corinthians to approach their Christian lives with this mindset, the mindset of a successful athlete. Translate this verse in a way that clearly connects the Christian life to a footrace. Alternate translation: “only one runner receives the prize after a race? You should live your lives like a runner who focuses on receiving the prize”

**"I run thus, not as without purpose; I fight thus, not as boxing the air"**

Here Paul uses two different athletic metaphors, the first from footraces and the second from boxing. Both metaphors emphasize how Paul remains focused on his goal. As a runner, he has a **purpose**, which is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. As a boxer, he does not box **the air** but rather focuses on striking his opponent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these figures of speech by stating the ideas plainly or by using analogies.

The clause **I subdue my body** could also be translated “I give my body a black eye.” Paul’s point is that he controls or rules over his **body**, just like boxers control or rule over any opponents that they have punched in the face. He does not mean that he physically hurts his body. Since this language would be misunderstood in English, the ULT has expressed the idea plainly.

**"were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea"**

In this verse, Paul refers to the story of when God brought the Israelites out of Egypt. For this story, see especially [Exodus 13:17–14:31](https://ref.ly/Exod13:17-Exod14:31). God appeared to the Israelites as a pillar of cloud and fire, and he led them and protected them with this pillar of cloud and fire. To get out of Egypt, God led them to a sea called the “Red Sea” or the “Sea of Reeds.” When the king of Egypt came to take the Israelites back to Egypt, God worked through Moses to divide the water of the sea and make a path for the Israelites to travel through. When the king of Egypt tried to follow them, God sent the water back, and the Egyptian army drowned. Paul draws special attention to the **cloud** and the **sea** because of what he will say in the next verse. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story.

Rather, he wants to connect the Israelites and the Corinthians, and one way to do that is to connect their leaders (**Moses** and Jesus). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind **baptized into Moses**by using an analogy or indicating that Paul is speaking.

**"rock following {them"**

Some early Jewish scholars used the two stories about the water coming from the rock to argue that it was the same rock in both stories. This means that the rock was **following** the Israelites as they journeyed through the desert. Paul seems to refer to this interpretation here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **following {them}** by including a footnote explaining why Paul speaks in this way.

**"the rock was Christ"**

Here Paul identifies the **rock** as **Christ**. By speaking in this way, he means that the rock was the source of water and life for the Israelites, just as **Christ** is the source of life for all those who believe in him. Paul also probably means that **Christ** was the one who made the water come from the **rock**. If possible, preserve Paul’s metaphor here. If you must express the idea in another, you could state a comparison between how the **rock** provided for the Israelites and how **Christ** provides for all his people, including the Israelites. Alternate translation: “they received water from that rock like we receive life from Christ” or “Christ provided for them through the rock, and he provides for us now”

**"they were scattered about in the wilderness"**

Here Paul speaks in general of how the Israelites left Egypt to go to the land that God had promised to give them. To get to that land, they traveled through **the wilderness**. However, the Israelites often disobeyed or grumbled against God, and so he **was not well pleased with most of them**. He punished them by letting most of them die **in the wilderness** and only allowing their children to enter the land that he had promised. See [Numbers 14:20–35](https://ref.ly/Num14:20-Num14:35) for God’s announcement of judgment. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story.

**"The people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play"**

This quotation comes from a story in which Moses has gone up on a mountain to meet with God. While he is gone, the Israelites make an idol and worship it. This quotation is how their worship is described. Paul chooses this verse because it refers specifically to food sacrificed to idols and to sexual immorality (**play**, see the next note), which are the topics he has discussed and will again discuss. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story.

By speaking in this way, Paul tells the Corinthians that God always provides a way to deal with a **temptation**, just as if a trap always had a **way of escape**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **way of escape** with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the way out” or “the way to withstand it”

Again, Paul is speaking about a **man** and a **woman**. Just as in [11:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:8), these words could refer to: (1\) the first **man** and **woman** that God created: Adam and Eve. In the story in [Genesis 2:18–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:25), God has already made Adam. God then has Adam name all the animals, but there was no “helper” for Adam. God then makes Eve as a “helper” for Adam. Alternate translation: “the first man was not created for the first woman, but the first woman was created for the first man” (2\) “men” and “women” in general. In this case, Paul would be referring to the relationship between males and females in general or to the specific relationship between husbands and wives. Alternate translation: “men were not created for women, but women for men” or “husbands were not created for wives, but wives for husbands”

**"man was not created"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on **man**, who is **created**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “creating.” If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “God did not create man”

Alternate translation: “Because of how the woman is the glory of the man and because of the angels, the woman” (2\) just what Paul has said in [11:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:7) about how “the woman is the glory of man.” Alternate translation: “Because of what I have said, the woman … because of the angels” (3\) just what Paul will say at the end of the verse about **the angels**.

**"to have authority on the head"**

The phrase **have authority on the head** could refer to: (1\) the **authority** that the “man” has over **the woman**. In this view, **authority** implies the head covering or long hair, which **the woman** wears as a sign of the man’s **authority** over her. Alternate translation: “to have a sign of the man’s authority on her head” (2\) how the **woman** has **authority** over her own **head**. In other words, she has **authority** to decide what to wear or not wear on her head, or **authority** could imply the head covering or long hair, which **the woman** wears as a sign of her **authority** over herself.

**"because of the angels"**

Here, **because of the angels** clearly means that Paul considers **the angels** to be a reason for why **the woman ought to have authority on the head**, whichever meaning of that clause you decide on. However, what Paul means by the phrase **because of the angels** is not clear. Therefore, you also should leave your translation open so that your readers could draw any of the following conclusions. The phrase **because of the angels** could refer to: (1\) how the angels oversee the order of the world and especially worship. The **woman** having **authority on the head** would satisfy what the angels require for worship practices. Alternate translation: “because of what the angels require” (2\) how the angels can be sexually attracted to earthly women, so **the woman ought to have authority on the head** to keep the angels from acting or being tempted to act sexually with women. Alternate translation: “because otherwise the angels would be tempted” (3\) how the angels are present in the worship of the community, and **the woman** must **have authority on the head** as a sign of respect to them. Alternate translation: “because angels are present when you worship”

**"in the Lord"**

Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ.

**"even as the woman {is} from the man, so also the man {is} through the woman"**

Here, **even as the woman {is} from the man** refers back to the story about how God made the first woman, Eve, from a rib he took from the first man, Adam. Paul has already referred to this story in [11:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:8). Paul then compares this with how **the man {is} through the woman**. This clause refers to how women give birth to men.

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no, it is not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this question with a strong negation. If you do, you may need to include a phrase such as “and you will find” after **Judge for your own selves**, which by itself introduces a question and not a statement. Alternate translation: “Judge for your own selves, and you will find that it is not proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered.” or “Judge for your own selves whether it is proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered.”

The question assumes that the answer is “yes, it does.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this question with a strong affirmation.

**"I hear {that"**

Here Paul does not state from whom he “heard” this information. He does this to avoid causing unnecessary conflict among the Corinthians based on who told things to Paul. If you must specify who spoke to Paul, you could use a vague or indefinite statement. Alternate translation: “I hear from somebody that”

Here, **in the church** is a spatial metaphor that speaks of **the church** as if it were a place in which the Corinthians could **come together**. Paul speaks in this way to indicate the situation in which the Corinthians **come together**: a gathering of believers that meet to worship God.

**"it is necessary indeed for there to be factions among you, so that also the ones approved may become evident among you"**

This sentence could be: (1\) a simple statement about how God uses **factions** to reveal **those who are approved**. Alternate translation: “God wishes to make evident among you those who are approved, and factions among you are a necessary part of this” (2\) an ironic statement that identifies **factions** as the **necessary** result of people who want to show themselves off as **those who are approved**. Use a standard form in your language to indicate irony, especially with the phrase **those who are approved**, which would be spoken from the Corinthians’ perspective.

**"factions"**

Here, **factions** has similar meaning to “divisions” in [11:18](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:18). The word **factions** focuses more on the content of the differing beliefs and practices than “divisions” does; “divisions” emphasizes the differences themselves. If your language can clearly express these distinctions, you could use words that express these two ideas. If your language does not clearly express these distinctions, you can translate **factions** with the same word you used for “divisions.” Alternate translation: “divisions”

**"approved"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **approved** rather than focusing on the person doing the “approving.” If you must state who did the action, you must choose a subject that fits with whether you understand this sentence as ironic or not. The subject could be: (1\) God, if the sentence is not ironic. Alternate translation: “whom God approves” (2\) the people themselves, if the sentence is ironic.

This is the implication if the sentence is not ironic. Alternate translation: “God may reveal also those who are approved” (2\) the **factions** are the means by which some people show off what they think about themselves as **approved**.

He does this in order to contrast this physical unity with the disunity that their eating practices show.

However, he and the Corinthians would have understood this when he speaks about “coming together.” Paul’s point is that they think they are eating **the Lord’s Supper**, but what they are doing does not actually count as **the Lord’s Supper**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that the idea behind **it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper** is that the Corinthians thought that they were eating **the Lord’s Supper**, but Paul thinks that they are not.

**"do you certainly not have houses in {which} to eat and to drink"**

With this question, Paul implies that the eating behaviors he criticized in the last verse could be appropriate in one’s own “house.” Paul’s point here, then, is that if they want to “take their own suppers first” ([11:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:21)), they should be eating at their own **houses**. Behavior at the Lord’s Supper needs to be different. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express why Paul asks this question more explicitly as it connects back to how the Corinthians are eating at the Lord’s Supper.

**"certainly not"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In Paul’s culture, two negative words made the question even more negative, which in this case expects a strong positive answer. English speakers would misunderstand two negatives, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as Paul’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you can translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “surely not”

With **Or**, then, Paul introduces the incorrect alternative: they could **despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing**. He introduces this incorrect alternate to show that the implication of his first question is true: they should be “eating” and “drinking” at home.

One of Jesus’ closest disciples, Judas Iscariot, made a deal with the religious leaders to “betray” Jesus to them (See: [Matthew 26:14–16](https://ref.ly/Matt26:14-Matt26:16); [Mark 14:10–11](https://ref.ly/Mark14:10-Mark14:11); [Luke 22:3–6](https://ref.ly/Luke22:3-Luke22:6)). After Jesus eats with his disciples and spends time praying, Judas leads the religious leaders to Jesus, and they arrest him (See: [Matthew 26:47–50](https://ref.ly/Matt26:47-Matt26:50); [Mark 14:43–46](https://ref.ly/Mark14:43-Mark14:46); [Luke 22:47–48](https://ref.ly/Luke22:47-Luke22:48); [John 18:2–12](https://ref.ly/John18:2-John18:12)). Paul is not primarily interested in this part of the story, but he mentions it to explain when Jesus **took bread**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express what **on the night in which he was betrayed** refers to with a footnote to explain the context or include some short, extra information.

Since Paul himself states the details, you should not need to state anything more explicitly than he does. The story of “The Last Supper” can also be found in [Matthew 26:20–29](https://ref.ly/Matt26:20-Matt26:29); [Mark 14:17–25](https://ref.ly/Mark14:17-Mark14:25); [Luke 22:14–23](https://ref.ly/Luke22:14-Luke22:23).

**"This cup is the new covenant in my blood"**

Here Paul refers to how Jesus identified the **cup** as **the new covenant in my blood**. This figure of speech has been interpreted in a number of ways. The wine in the **cup** could somehow become Jesus’ **blood**, or Jesus’ **blood** could be present in some way when people drink from the **cup**, or the wine in the **cup** could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **blood**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible. Alternate translation: “This cup represents the new covenant in my blood”

Rather, whenever they **drink** from **the cup** in the context of the **remembrance** of Jesus, they should **Do this**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **as often as you drink it** to identity more clearly what **it** means.

To **wait for one another** could be a command to: (1\) avoid receiving food before others. This could prohibit people from receiving food that was specially prepared for them ahead of time in proportion to their social status. Or, it could prohibit the people who were served first from eating more than their fair share and using up all the food before others were served.

## 1 Corinthians 11:34 (#9) (id: 242050)

**"when I come"**

Here Paul is speaking about his plan to visit the Corinthians at some point. The language that he uses indicates that he does not yet have a plan for how and when he will visit. What he is saying is that he does plan to visit them at some point. Use a form in your language that indicates future travel plans. Alternate translation: “whenever I can next visit you”

**"Now about the spiritual gifts"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nJust as in [8:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1), **Now about** introduces a new topic that Paul wishes to address. Likely, the topics that he introduces in this way are those about which the Corinthians wrote to him. Translate **Now about** here as you translated it in [8:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1). Alternate translation: “Next, about”

## 1 Corinthians 12:1 (#2) (id: 242052)

**"the spiritual gifts"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere, **spiritual gifts** refers to how the Holy Spirit enables specific believers to do specific things. Paul gives a list of some of these **spiritual gifts** in [12:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:8-1Cor12:10). These **gifts** should not be understood as “abilities” that the believer naturally has. Rather, the **gifts** are ways in which the Holy Spirit works through a specific person to do specific things that not everyone else can do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **spiritual gifts** with a different word or phrase that gets this idea across while maintaining some reference to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “abilities given by the Holy Spirit” or “ways that the Holy Spirit equips believers”

**"brothers"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nAlthough **brothers** is in masculine form, Paul is using it to refer to any believer, whether man or woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **brothers** with a non gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters”

## 1 Corinthians 12:1 (#4) (id: 242054)

**"I do not want you to be ignorant"**

Here Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that has a meaning opposite to that of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I want you to have knowledge” or “I want you to be very knowledgeable”

## 1 Corinthians 12:2 (#1) (id: 242055)

**"you were led astray to the mute idols, in whatever ways you were led"**

Here, **led astray** and **led** refer to how one person can “lead” another person to a specific place. Paul uses this figure of speech here because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they used to worship idols as if somebody were “leading” them **astray** or away from the correct path. This figure of speech emphasizes that the Corinthians were going the wrong way and that someone or something was directing them to go that way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “you wrongly followed mute idols, in whatever ways you followed them” or “you were urged to worship mute idols, in whatever ways you were urged to do so”

## 1 Corinthians 12:2 (#2) (id: 242056)

**"you were led astray to the mute idols, in whatever ways you were led"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to avoid identifying who did the “leading astray,” because he wishes to keep it general. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “other pagans” or “something” did it. Alternate translation: “others led you astray to mute idols, in whatever ways they led you”

**"the mute idols"**

Here, **mute** means that the **idols** cannot speak to those who worship them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **mute** with a word or phrase to describe the **idols** as unable to speak. Alternate translation: “idols who cannot communicate”

## 1 Corinthians 12:3 (#1) (id: 242059)

**"Therefore"**

Here, **Therefore** could draw a conclusion from: (1\) [12:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor12:2). The Corinthians “know” about how pagan worship worked (verse 2\), but Paul wants to tell them more about how Christian worship works (verse 1\). **Therefore**, he will make this **known** to them. Alternate translation: “Because you know less about Christian worship” (2\) just [12:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:2). The Corinthians were accustomed to how “inspired speech” or **speaking** by the power of a god worked when they “were pagans.” Now, Paul wants to tell them about how it works by the power of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “Now, however”

## 1 Corinthians 12:3 (#2) (id: 242060)

**"the Spirit of God"** \- **"the Holy Spirit"**

Here, **Spirit of God** and **Holy Spirit** are two different names for the same person: the Holy Spirit. If your language uses only one name for the Holy Spirit, and if your readers would think that two different persons are identified in this verse, you could use the same name in both places in this verse. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit … the Holy Spirit” or “the Spirit of God … the Spirit of God”

## 1 Corinthians 12:3 (#3) (id: 242061)

**"speaking by the Spirit of God"** \- **"by the Holy Spirit"**

Here, **speaking by the Spirit of God** refers to words that the **Spirit of God** has enabled someone to say. This could be more formal, such as in prophecy or preaching, or it could be less formal, referring to everyday speech. Paul does not specify exactly what he has in mind since the Corinthians would have understood what he implied. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind what **speaking by the Spirit of God** means in a way that more clearly refers to the **Spirit** empowering someone to “speak.” Alternate translation: “speaking as the Spirit of God leads them … as the Holy Spirit leads them” or “speaking in the power of the Spirit of God … in the power of the Holy Spirit”

Instead, he slowly explains how **Christ** is like **the body** throughout the following verses. In [12:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:27), he fully explains what he means: “you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.” Because Paul goes on to explain what **so also {is} Christ** means in the next verses, you should express this phrase by emphasizing the comparison between **the body** and **Christ** but without giving any more detail.

Paul uses this metaphor throughout the following verses, and it is an important metaphor for 1 Corinthians and for Christian teaching.

It is possible that he speaks in this way to make the Corinthians think about the Lord’s Supper (“drinking the cup”), especially since the beginning of the verse speaks of being **baptized**.

Just as in [12:18](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:18), **But now** introduces what is true, in contrast with the hypothetical situations Paul offered in the last verse (12:19\). The word **now** does not refer to time here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **But now** with a word or phrase that introduces reality in contrast to a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “In reality, though,” or “As it really is,”

**"there are} many members"**

Here, **many members** refers to many kinds of **member**. In other words, it does not indicate that there are many examples of one body part (many arms, for example). Rather, it indicates that there are many different types of **members** (ears, legs, and arms, for example). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **many members** by clarifying that Paul has in mind many different kinds of **members**. Alternate translation: “there are many types of members”

**"but one body"**

**"the eye is not able"** \- **"the head to the feet"**

Here Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Corinthians. He wants them to imagine that an **eye** and a **head** could talk to other body parts. He uses this hypothetical situation because, if these body parts could talk, they would never say **“I have no need of you”** to other body parts. His point is that human body parts work together; they do not try to get rid of each other. Use a natural way in your language to introduce a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “suppose that the eye could speak. It is not able … suppose that the head could speak. It is not able to say to the feet”

**"the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you"**

Here Paul speaks as if an **eye** and a **head** could say things. He speaks in this way because he wants the Corinthians to think of themselves as body parts of the body of Christ, and so the **eye** and the **head** are examples for them. He also wishes them to see how absurd it would be if an **eye** or a **head** were to say that it did not need other body parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech by clarifying that this is a hypothetical situation in which an **eye** or a **head** can say things. Alternate translation: “say that an eye could talk. It is not able to say to the hand, ‘I do not have need of you.’ Or again, say that a head could talk. It is not able to say to the hand, ‘I do not have need of you.’”

He implies a comparison with other body parts, which are “stronger” but “less essential.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this general principle or what Paul is comparing more explicitly.

**"and those of the body which we think to be less honorable, we bestow them greater honor; and our unpresentable members have more dignity"**

Throughout this verse, Paul is most likely thinking about how we carefully wear clothing that covers our **less honorable** and **unpresentable** body parts. He does not specify which body parts these would be, but it is likely that he has genital organs in mind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that Paul has clothing in mind as the way we **bestow** some body parts with **greater honor** or give them **more dignity**.

**"giving more honor to the one lacking {it"**

Here Paul implies that the body parts that “lack” honor receive **more honor** from God. The Corinthians would have understood this clause to mean that God is the one who created the body, so that what Paul has already stated in [12:23–24](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:23-1Cor12:24) is true. God has made the body in such a way that we give more honor and dignity to the private and less honorable body parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this implication more plainly by including what humans think about the body parts.

He speaks in this way because he wants the Corinthians to think of themselves as **members** of the body of Christ, and so the **members** of a human body are an example for them. Here, he specifically has in mind the idea that an injury or infection in one body part (a finger, for example) has an effect on the entire body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with an analogy or express the idea plainly.

Paul used **body** language throughout this whole paragraph, and it is an important metaphor for 1 Corinthians and for Christian teaching. Because of this, you should preserve this metaphor or, if you must express the idea differently, use an analogy.

Here, **tongues** refers to something that one does with one’s “tongue,” which is to speak a language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that **tongues** is a way of speaking about “languages” by using a comparable term or expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of languages”

**"Not all {are} apostles, are they? Not all {are} prophets, are they? Not all {are} teachers, are they? Not all {do} miracles, do they"**

Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer is “no, they are not” or “no, they do not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these questions by stating the ideas as strong negations. Alternate translation: “Not all are apostles. Not all are prophets. Not all are teachers. Not all do miracles.”

Here Paul is speaking about the same “gift” that he mentioned in [12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10) as “the interpretation of tongues.” He does not mention what the person “interprets” here because he knows that the Corinthians will infer that he is speaking about the **tongues** in the previous question. If your readers would not infer what the person “interprets,” you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “interpret tongues, do they”

Paul speaks in this way to describe the abstract idea of **love** in more concrete ways that are easier to think about. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make Paul’s description of **love** more concrete in another way, such as by speaking about the “people” who **love**.

**"is patient {and} is kind"**

Here Paul does not connect **is patient** and **is kind** with any other words. He does this because he wants the Corinthians to think of these two ideas as closely connected. Since English speakers would misunderstand this connection, the ULT has added “and” to clarify that these two ideas are connected. If your readers would also misunderstand the connection, you could add a connecting word like the ULT does or you could express **is kind** as its own thought.

Paul does not state the objects because he wants the description to be general and easily applied to many situations. If you must express objects, the verbs **bears** and **endures** imply that a person **bears** and **endures** bad things that other people do.

**"It bears"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere, **bears** could refer to: (1\) keeping things that are outside from getting inside. The point here would be that “love” is able to “bear” or endure bad things that other people do. Alternate translation: “It endures” or “It tolerates” (2\) keeping things that are inside from getting outside. The point here would be that “love” protects or shields other people from bad things. Alternate translation: “It protects against”

**"if {there are} prophecies, they will pass away; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will pass away"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere Paul uses the conditional form to identify what he is speaking about. This form does not mean that Paul is unsure about whether **prophecies**, **tongues**, and **knowledge** currently exist. Rather, Paul uses this form to identify each one as the topic of the rest of the clause. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind Paul’s use of **if** hereby using a contrast word such as “although” or by simplifying the clauses so that they do not use **if**. Alternate translation: “although there are prophecies, they will pass away; although there are tongues, they will cease; although there is knowledge, it will pass away” or “prophecies will pass away; tongues will cease; knowledge will pass away”

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. If you need these words, you could supply a phrase such as “there are” or “there is.” Since English does need these words in the first clause, the ULT supplies them. You could supply them in just the first clause or in all of the clauses.

**"the perfect comes"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere Paul speaks as if **the perfect** could “come,” by which he means that people experience **the perfect**. He uses this metaphor because he uses the verb **comes** also for Jesus’ return (See: [4:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:5); [11:26](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:26)), and he wishes to identify the coming of **the perfect** with the coming of Jesus. The time when **the perfect comes** will be when Jesus comes back. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly and connect **the perfect** to Jesus’ return in another way. Alternate translation: “we experience the perfect at Jesus’ return”

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere, **that which {is} partial** refers back to the “knowing” and “prophesying” in [13:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:9). The phrase **the perfect** contrasts with **partial**, so **the perfect** refers to full knowledge and experience of God and of what God says. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind what **perfect** and **partial** refer to more explicitly. Alternate translation: “the perfect experience of God … the partial experience of God, including knowledge and prophecy,”

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere Paul uses the first person **I** to describe himself as an example, but he implies that most people experience what he describes here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **I** with a form that provides a general example.

**"unclearly in a mirror"**

Here Paul speaks as if **we** were looking at **a mirror** and could see a reflection **unclearly**. With this metaphor, Paul could be expressing the idea: (1\) that **now** we can **see** God only indirectly, like a reflection **in a mirror** is an indirect image. Alternate translation: “an indirect reflection of God, as if we were looking in a mirror” (2\) that **now** we can only **see** some things about God, like a **mirror** only imperfectly reflects an image.

**"but then, face"**

Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous clause (**we see**). If your language does need these words, you could supply them from that clause, but in the future tense. Alternate translation: “but then, we will see face”

**"but then, face to face"**

Here, **face to face** identifies an action or situation as something that takes place in person. In other words, a person can actually see the other person’s **face**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **face to face** with a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly.

**"Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known"**

Here Paul switches from first\-person plural to first\-person singular. Since he is using himself as an example for every believer, there is no special meaning behind the switch. Rather, Paul changes from plural to singular because it was good style in his culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this verse in first\-person plural as well, or you could include words that clarify that Paul is using himself as an example.

**"I also have been fully known"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive here to focus on the person who is **known** rather than focusing on the one doing the “knowing.” If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it.

**"faith, hope, {and} love"**

If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **faith**, **hope**, and **love**, you can express ideas by using verbs. If you do so, you may need to specify objects for those verbs. Paul implies that **faith** is in God, **hope** is in what God has promised, and **love** is for God and others.

If your language has words that fit with these distinctions, you could use them here. If your language does not have words that fit with these distinctions, you can use one general word for “exhortation” or **encouragement**. Alternate translation: “exhortation”

Here, just as in [14:2–3](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:2-1Cor14:3), Paul is speaking of people “prophesying” and people “speaking in tongues” in general, not of two particular people.

With this metaphor, he emphasizes that **The one speaking in a tongue** helps himself or herself become stronger and more mature, while **the one prophesying** helps other believers become stronger and more mature, just like the one who builds a house makes it strong and complete.

The ULT puts these clauses in parentheses because they give a qualification of what Paul has said about how **the one prophesying is greater than the one speaking in tongues**. In this clause, Paul clarifies that he is only speaking about **tongues** without interpretation. Further, if someone does **interpret** the **tongues**, then that can lead to **building up**, just like prophecy. Use a form in your language that would indicate a qualification or a parenthesis.

In other words, if every language communicates meaning ([14:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:10)), **then** a person who does not understand that meaning is **a foreigner** to the person who speaks that language. Alternate translation: “Therefore, if” (2\) a contrast with the previous verse. In other words, although every language communicates meaning ([14:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:10)), a person who does not understand the language cannot grasp that meaning. Alternate translation: “But if”

**"If then I would not know the meaning of the language"**

Here Paul uses the conditional form to show that not knowing **the meaning of the language** leads to being a **foreigner to the one speaking** that language. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause\-and\-effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **If** statement in a way that does show the relationship.

**"do not become children"** \- **"be childlike in evil"**

Here, much like in [13:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:11), Paul compares people to **children**. He is particularly thinking about how children do not know very much or do very much. Paul does not want the Corinthians to be like children in how children know very little. Rather, he wants the Corinthians to be like children in how children do very little **evil**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech as an analogy or in a nonfigurative way. If possible, preserve the metaphor, because Paul has already used “child” language in [13:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:11). Alternate translation: “do not be immature, like children, … do very little evil, like children,”

**"In the Law it is written"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to emphasize the words rather than emphasizing whoever wrote the words. If you must state who did the action, you can use a vague or indefinite subject.

Then, he wants them to imagine what would happen if **ungifted or unbelievers** are present and hear **all** speaking **in tongues**.

## 1 Corinthians 14:27 (#1) (id: 242417)

**"If"**

Paul is speaking as if someone “speaking” **in a tongue** was a hypothetical possibility, but he knows that someone often does “speak” **in a tongue**. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can express the idea with a word that refers to a situation rather than to a possibility. Alternate translation: “Whenever”

**"it should be} by two or at most three"**

Paul does not explicitly state in what situation only **two or at most three** believers should speak **in a tongue**. The Corinthians would have understood him to be speaking about each time the believers gathered to worship God (See: the expression “in the church” in [14:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:28)). Paul does not mean that only **two or most three** people can ever speak in tongues. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express what situation Paul is speaking about more explicitly.

Alternate translation: “let the women be silent when their husbands are prophesying … to speak when their husbands are prophesying” (2\) speaking or not speaking in disruptive ways, particularly asking questions improperly, talking loudly, or speaking out of turn. Paul is using **be silent** as he did in [14:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:28), [30](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:30): it does not prohibit any kind of talking but refers to “keeping quiet” when speaking would be disruptive.

**"to be in submission"**

Here Paul does not state to whom or what the **women** are **to be in submission**. If possible, you also should not express what they are **to be in submission** to. If you must consider the object of **submission**, Paul could imply that the **submission** is to: (1\) husbands (or other close male relatives). Alternate translation: “to be in submission to their husbands” (2\) to the order God has given the church. Alternate translation: “to act in line with the order of the church” (3\) to the church as a whole, particularly the leaders.

However, it may just be a more general reference to the first five books of the Old Testament (the “Pentateuch”) or to the entire Old Testament (as Paul uses **law** in [14:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:21)). If possible, do not clarify what meaning of **law** Paul had in mind, since he does not identify exactly what he means by **law**.

Paul uses **Or** to indicate that thinking that **the word of God** went **out from** them is the opposite of obeying what he has said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Or** with a word or phrase that introduces an alternative. Alternate translation: “Suppose you do not want to follow my instructions.

**"Or did the word of God go out from you? Or did it come only to you"**

Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to both is “no, it did not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these questions by stating the ideas with strong negations. If you do so, you will need to replace **Or** with different transition words. Alternate translation: “Indeed, the word of God certainly did not go out from you, and it certainly did not come only to you.”

## 1 Corinthians 15:3 (#3) (id: 242509)

**"what I also received"**

Here Paul does not clarify from whom he **received** this information. In [11:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:23), which uses very similar words, Paul says that he “received” things “from the Lord.” Here, then, it is likely that he also **received** what he is about to say “from the Lord.” However, he may also mean that he **received** this specific way of expressing the good news from another human being. Since Paul avoids stating from whom he **received** what he is about to say, you should also try to avoid stating it. If you must state whom he **received** it from, you could refer to “the Lord” or generally to people. Alternate translation: “what I also received from the Lord” or “what I also received from others”

## 1 Corinthians 15:13 (#1) (id: 242557)

**"if there is no resurrection of the dead"**

Here, **there is no resurrection of the dead** repeats the words found at the end of the last verse ([15:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:12)). Paul repeats these words to make what he is arguing very clear. If your readers do not need these words to be repeated, and if they would be confused about why Paul is repeating himself, you could refer back to the words in the previous verse with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “if that were true”

## 1 Corinthians 15:13 (#2) (id: 242558)

**"if there is no resurrection of the dead"**

Here Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that there really is a **resurrection of the dead**. He uses this form to show the Corinthians the implications of their claim that “there is no resurrection of the dead” (See: [15:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:12)). Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “if there actually were no resurrection of the dead”

**"of the ones having fallen asleep"**

Here Paul is referring to people who have died as **the ones having fallen asleep**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **the ones having fallen asleep** with a different polite way of referring to those who have died, or you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “those who have passed away” or “those who are dead”

**"since"**

Here, **since** introduces a logical statement about how things work. Paul assumes that everyone agrees that **death {is} by a man**. His point is that, **since** things work that way, **by a man also resurrection of the dead**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **since** with a word or phrase that introduces this kind of logical connection. Alternate translation: “since we know that” or “because it is true that”

## 1 Corinthians 15:21 (#3) (id: 242607)

**"is} by a man, by a man also"**

Here, the first **man** that Paul refers to would be “Adam,” the first man. When Adam sinned, **death** became a part of human life (See: especially [Genesis 3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:19)). The second **man** that Paul refers to is Christ, whose resurrection guarantees and begins the **resurrection of the dead**. However, since Paul explains this in the next verse ([15:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22)), if possible do not include this information here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **a man** to make it clear that a specific **man** is in view in both cases. Alternate translation: “is by a specific man, by a specific man also”

**"death {is} by a man, by a man also resurrection"**

In both clauses, Paul omits the verb **{is}** because the Corinthians would infer it. If your readers would not infer this verb, you could include it in the first clause (as the ULT does) or in both clauses. Alternate translation: “death is by a man, by a man also is the resurrection”

**"of the dead"**

## 1 Corinthians 15:22 (#1) (id: 242611)

**"in Adam"** \- **"in Christ"**

Here Paul uses the spatial metaphors **in Adam** and **in Christ** to describe the union of people with **Adam** and **Christ**. Paul does not specify how this union occurs, but what is clear is that those who are united to **Adam** will **die**, while those who are united to **Christ** will **be made alive**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly.

**"all will be made alive"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive here to focus on **all**, who **will be made alive**, rather than focusing on the one making them **alive**. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “God will make all alive”

**"all"**

Here, **all** contrasts with the **all** who are **in Adam** earlier in the sentence. Paul is not trying to argue about how many people **will be made alive again**. Rather he is contrasting how **all** who are **in Adam** end up dying, while **all** who are **in Christ** end up being **made alive**. If your readers would think that Paul is making a claim about how many people are **made alive**, you could use a word or phrase that identifies **all** as those who are **in Christ**.

**"Christ the firstfruits"**

Here, just as in [15:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20), **firstfruits** refers to what farmers first gathered from their fields. Often, these **firstfruits** were offered to God to thank him for providing food. What Paul emphasizes here is that **firstfruits** implies that there will be more “fruits”, that is, crops or produce. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that Paul uses **firstfruits** to emphasize that Jesus’ resurrection implies that there will be more resurrections with an analogy or express the idea plainly.

Paul does not clarify how soon after the “coming” these events will happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Then** with a word or phrase that more clearly identifies events happening in sequence. Alternate translation: “Next will be”

**"the end"**

Here, **the end** identifies that something has reached its goal and thus ended. Paul does not state explicitly what **end** he has in mind, but the Corinthians would have inferred that he meant **the end** of the world as it currently exists. This does not mean that there will be no more world, but it means that things will be very different after **the end**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind what **end** Paul is speaking about explicitly.

If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **rule**, **authority**, and **power**, you can express the idea by using verbs such as “rule,” “govern,” and “control.” Paul is speaking here about the position or ability to have **rule** and **authority** and **power**, so you can refer to the position or ability itself, or you can refer to the person or thing that fills that position or has that ability.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express why Paul uses **all** with only two of the three items with one **all** to modify the whole list, or you could repeat **all** with each item.

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive here to focus on **all things** that are **subjected**, rather than focusing on the one doing the “subjecting.” If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “God has subjected all things”

**"the Son"**

Paul here refers to God **the Son** as opposed to God “the Father,” whom he referred to in [15:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24). Use a translation that clearly refers to God **the Son**. Alternate translation: “God’s Son”

**"the Son himself will also be subjected"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive here to focus on **the Son** who is **subjected**, rather than focusing on the one doing the “subjecting.” If you must state who does the action, Paul could imply that: (1\) the **Son** does it to himself.

**"what will the ones being baptized for the dead do"**

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing.

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on those who are getting **baptized** rather than focusing on the person doing the “baptizing.” If you must state who does the action, you can use a vague or indefinite subject.

**"will the ones being baptized for the dead do?"** \- **"are they baptized for them"**

It is unclear what **being baptized for the dead** actually means and what kind of practice it refers to. What is clear is that the practice only makes sense if one believes that **the dead** are **raised**. If possible, express these phrases in general terms. Two of the most common ways to understand **being baptized for the dead** are that it could refer to: (1\) the practice of living believers receiving baptism in place of people who died without being baptized. Alternate translation: “will those do who are baptized in place of the dead … are they baptized in their place” (2\) people receiving baptism because they believe that the **dead** will “rise.” They could be expecting their own resurrection or the resurrection of people they knew who are **dead**. Alternate translation: “will those do who are baptized with the dead in mind … are they baptized with them in mind”

**"the dead"** \- **"the dead"**

Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the dead people … the dead people” or “the corpses … the corpses”

Here Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that **the dead** really are **raised**. He uses this form to show the Corinthians the implications of their claim that **the dead are not raised**.

**"Be sober"**

Here, **Be sober** refers to someone becoming **sober** after they were drunk. Paul speaks in this way to characterize how the Corinthians are acting and thinking as if they were drunk. He wants them to no longer act as if they are in a stupor or asleep and instead be alert and in their right mind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Be sober** with a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “Be in your right mind” or “Be alert”

**"What you sow is not caused to live unless it dies"**

In [15:36–38](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:36-1Cor15:38), Paul speaks about how farmers **sow** seeds as an analogy for understanding how the dead resurrect. In this verse, the point is that seeds have a new kind of “life” after they are buried in the ground and thus “die.” Just like this, humans also have a new kind of “life” after they “die.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this to make it clear that Paul is using an analogy.

**"What you sow is not caused to live unless it dies"**

Here Paul speaks about farming practices that were common in his culture. A farmer would **sow** seeds on the dirt in a field, and the seed would sink into the field and seemingly “die.” Only after a period where it lies “dead” in the ground does the seed **live** in new form as a plant. You could use words or phrases that describe these kinds of farming practices in your culture. Paul specifically uses **live** and **die** to connect the farming practices to human life and death, so if possible use terms that can apply to both humans and seeds.

**"you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare seed—perhaps wheat or something else"**

Here Paul continues to use an analogy from farming. In this verse, he focuses on how the living plant that grows from a seed looks nothing like that seed. The key verbal connection between humans and plants is the word **body**, so if possible use the same word to refer to the human **body** and the **body** of the plant **that will be**. Alternate translation: “you sow only a bare seed, perhaps wheat or something else, not the body of the plant that will grow”

## 1 Corinthians 15:37 (#4) (id: 242716)

**"the body that will be"**

Here, **the body that will be** identifies the plant that will later grow from the seed. Paul’s point is that one does not **sow** something that looks like the fully grown plant. Rather, one sows **a bare seed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **the body that will be** with a word or phrase that refers to a fully grown plant. If possible, use the same word for **body** that you have used for the human body, since Paul is using **body** to connect what he says about plants with what he is saying about the resurrection.

**"God gives it a body just as he desires, and to each of the seeds, its own body"**

Here Paul concludes his analogy about farming. In the last verse he proved that seeds grow into bodies that look nothing like the seeds. Here, he shows that God is one who decides what **body** a seed grows into and that God gives different kinds of “bodies” to different kinds of seeds. Again, the main verbal connection between human resurrection and seeds growing is the word **body**, so if possible use a word for **body** that can apply to both seeds and humans.

## 1 Corinthians 15:43 (#1) (id: 242743)

**"It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power"**

Here Paul repeats **is sown in**, **is raised in**, and similar structure in three consecutive sentences (See: the end of [15:42](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:42)). This was worded powerfully in his culture, and it emphasizes the three distinctions between how the body **is sown** and **raised**. If it would be helpful in your language, and if it would not be worded powerfully in your culture, you could indicate why Paul repeats words and structure by eliminate some or all of the repetition and by making the statements powerful in another way. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to omit “What is sown in decay is raised in immortality” in [15:42](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:42), since the alternate translation includes that idea. Alternate translation: “What is sown in dishonorable decay is raised in glorious immortality” or “What is sown in decay, dishonor, and weakness is raised in immortality, glory, and power”

**"It is sown in dishonor;"** \- **"It is sown in weakness"**

Here, just as in [15:42](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:42), Paul speaks as if a dead body were **sown** like a seed. He speaks in this way to connect how a dead body is buried in the ground to how a seed is **sown** in the ground. However, Paul does not continue the metaphor when he talks about how the body **is raised**, since those are his normal words for speaking about resurrection. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **is sown** with a comparable phrase that applies to both seeds and human bodies, or you could express the idea using an analogy. Alternate translation: “The body is put in the ground in dishonor, just like a seed … The body is put in the ground in weakness, just like a seed” or “It is planted in dishonor … It is planted in weakness”

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form here to focus on the body that **is sown** and **raised** rather than focusing on the people who do those actions. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “people” do the sowing and “God” does the raising. Alternate translation: “People sow it … God raises it … People sow it … God raises it”

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **image**, you can express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” or “participate.” Alternate translation: “how we reflect the earthly … how we reflect the heavenly” or “the way we participate in the earthly … the way we participate in the heavenly”

## 1 Corinthians 15:49 (#4) (id: 242782)

**"of the earthly,"** \- **"of the heavenly"**

Paul is using the adjectives **earthly** and **heavenly** as nouns in order to refer to bodies that are **earthly** and **heavenly**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “of the earthly body … of the heavenly body”

**"of the earthly,"** \- **"of the heavenly"**

Here Paul does not specify whose bodies **the earthly** and **the heavenly** refer to. However, the previous verses imply that the **earthly** body belongs to the “first man,” Adam, while the **heavenly** body belongs to the “second man,” Jesus. If your readers would not make this inference, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the earthly body that belongs to the first man … of the heavenly body that belongs to the second man”

**"let us also bear"**

Here Paul uses the exhortation **let us also bear** in order to urge all believers to act in such a way that God will raise them so that they have a body like the **heavenly** man, Jesus. Paul does not think that people change themselves into the **image of the heavenly**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **let us also bear** by clarifying that Paul is urging everyone to live in a certain way. Alternate translation: “let us think and act so that we also bear”

**"let us also bear"**

In Paul’s language, **let us also bear** and “we will also bear” look and sound very similar. Both options have some evidence to support them. Consider whether translations your readers might be familiar with choose one of the options. If there is no strong reason to choose one option over the other, you could follow the ULT.

**"flesh and blood are not able to inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does the perishable inherit the imperishable"**

Here Paul makes two very similar statements in which **flesh and blood** goes with **perishable** and **the kingdom of God** goes with **imperishable**. These two statements could: (1\) be basically synonymous, and Paul repeats himself to emphasize the point. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two sentences into one to show why Paul uses two parallel sentences. Alternate translation: “perishable flesh and blood are not able to inherit the imperishable kingdom of God” (2\) refer first to people who are alive (**flesh and blood**) and then to people who are dead (**perishable**).

Here Paul speaks of **the kingdom of God** that is **imperishable** as if it were property that a parent could pass on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that believers will eventually receive and live in **the3 kingdom of God** that God has promised to them.

In Paul’s culture, people knew that a **trumpet** would **sound** to signal the Day of the Lord, in this case, the day when Jesus comes back, the dead rise, and the world is renewed. An angel or archangel would blow this trumpet. If your readers would not make such inferences about **the last trumpet**, you could express some of these ideas explicitly.

**"Death is swallowed up in victory"**

Here the quote refers to **Death** as if it were food that could be **swallowed up**. This illustrates that **Death** has been defeated as surely as if someone devoured it as though death were food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly.

**"Death is swallowed up in victory"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive here to focus on **Death**, which **is swallowed up**, rather than focusing on the person or thing doing the “swallowing.” If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it.

**""Death, where {is} your victory?"**

If it would be helpful in your language, and if it would not be worded powerfully in your culture, you could indicate why Paul repeats words and structure by eliminate some or all of the repetition and by making the statements powerful in another way.

**""Death, where {is} your victory?"**

Paul does not quote these questions because he is looking for information about **where** death’s **victory** and **sting** are. Rather, the questions involve the Corinthians in what Paul is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “nowhere.” In other words, there is no **victory** or **sting** for **Death**.

Paul is speaking as if **Timothy** coming was a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. He has already stated that he has sent Timothy to the Corinthians (See: [4:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:17)).

**"I urge you, brothers (you know the household of Stephanas, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to service of the saints"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nHere Paul begins a sentence with **I urge you, brothers**. He continues this sentence in the next verse with “that you also would be subject” (See: [16:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:16)). The rest of this verse interrupts that sentence with information about the people that Paul is going to speak about. The ULT indicates this interruption by using parentheses. If your readers would find this interruption confusing, you could use markers that indicate such an interruption in your language, or you could rearrange the verse so that **I urge you, brothers** goes more directly with the next verse. Alternate translation: “you know the household of Stephanas, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you, brothers,”

In Paul’s culture, it was normal for a scribe to write down what the author of the letter was saying. Paul here indicates that he himself is writing these last words.

**"let him be accursed"**

## Philippians 1:7 (#1) (id: 245536)

**"I have you in my heart"**

The phrase, **I have you in my heart** is an idiom which expresses strong affection. If you have an equivalent expression which adequately communicates the meaning, you may use it here. If not, you could state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “I love you very much”

## Philippians 1:7 (#4) (id: 245539)

**"my chains"**

Paul refers to his imprisonment in Rome by using the phrase **my chains**. Paul was chained to a guard and the Philippian Christians would have understood that Paul was referring to his imprisonment when he used the phrase **my chains** because of the close association between **chains** and being in prison. If this association is not clear in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Philippians 1:7 (#5) (id: 245540)

**"and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel"**

The words translated **defense** and **confirmation** could be used to refer to defending and confirming in a court of law the truth of something against which a charge was made. These two words mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize that this is hard work. If your language has one word for these ideas, use that here and add emphasis another way. If there is a word or phrase that could be used with this legal sense but could also be used in the context of defending the gospel, consider using it here. Alternate translation: “and as I contend for the truth of the gospel” or “and as I labor to show people that the gospel is true”

**"with the inner parts of Christ Jesus"**

The Greek word translated as **inner parts** is a term which refers to body organs, particularly to the intestines, liver, lungs, and heart.

## Philippians 1:9 (#1) (id: 245543)

## Philippians 1:9 (#3) (id: 245545)

**"in knowledge and all understanding"**

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Philippians 1:10 (#1) (id: 245546)

**"so that you may approve {what} excels"**

The word **{what}** here refers to that which a person does, and the word **excels** here refers to something that is best, according to God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that you may approve and choose to do what pleases God the most”

**"pure and blameless"**

## Philippians 1:11 (#1) (id: 245549)

**"being filled with the fruit of righteousness {that is"**

Here, the phrase **being filled with** is a metaphor meaning to be occupied in doing something. The phrase **the fruit of righteousness** is a metaphor which refers to what characterizes a person, namely what a person produces. This metaphor is a comparison between a good tree that produces good fruit and a person who is filled with righteousness and produces good actions as a result. So with these two metaphors, Paul is telling the Philippians to be occupied in doing righteous deeds. If this would be unclear in your language, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “filling your lives with the righteous deeds that are” or “habitually doing the good works that are”

## Philippians 1:11 (#4) (id: 245552)

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Philippians 1:11 (#5) (id: 245553)

**"to the glory and praise of God"**

**"for my boasting on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain"**

With the phrase **for my boasting on the day of Christ**, Paul introduces a reason that the Philippian believers should try to live out the things he has just told them to do in [2:12](https://ref.ly/Phil2:12) and ending with the phrase “holding forth the word of life.” Paul here gives one reason for what he has just asked them to do. He says that if they live out what he has just told them, then when Christ returns, he can be proud of the fact that he did not work in vain among them. Consider the best way in your language to show this reason\-result relationship.

**"I did not run in vain nor labor in vain"**

The phrases **run in vain** and **labor in vain** have very similar meanings here. Paul uses these two phrases together to emphasize how hard he has worked to help people believe in Christ and mature in their obedience and love for him.

**"I did not run in vain"**

Here Paul uses the word **run** metaphorically to mean “work.” Here Paul specifically means that he worked for the advancement of the gospel among the Philippians. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Philippians’ minds the image of a runner who is racing toward a finish line in order to win a prize. If this image is familiar to people in your culture, consider using this metaphor. But if this image is not familiar to your readers, consider stating this idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “I did not work for the advancement of the gospel uselessly” or “I did not work for the spread of the good news for nothing” or “I did not run the race uselessly”

**"I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith"**

The phrase **I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice** uses imagery from the Old Testament Jewish sacrificial system. A priest would sacrifice an animal on the altar as a burnt offering to God and then pour out wine as a drink offering to God, in order to make the sacrifice complete. See [28:7](https://ref.ly/Num28:7). If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, consider using it here, but if this imagery would be confusing in your culture, consider translating this imagery using plain language.

The **lack of service** Paul speaks of here is the inability of the Philippian believers to be present with him in prison.

The phrases **the dogs**, **the evil workers**, and **the mutilation** are three different ways of describing the same group of Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel. Paul uses strong expressions to convey his feelings about these Jewish teachers.

* **Associated Passages:** PHP 3:2

## Philippians 3:2 (#4) (id: 245770)

**"the dogs"**

Paul speaks of the Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel as though they were **dogs** in order to show strong contempt for them. A dog is an animal that is common in many parts of the world. Dogs are despised in some cultures but not despised in other cultures, so using the term **dogs** in some cultures may not have the same derogatory or negative meaning that Paul intended. If you have a different animal in your culture that is despised or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead, if it would fit well in this context.

**"the mutilation"**

The word **mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to circumcision, and the phrase **the mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to the people who taught that circumcision was necessary in order to be in right standing with God. By using the term **mutilation**, Paul is showing the Philippian believers that those who trust in circumcision, and not solely in Christ, mistakenly think that they can earn God’s favor by cutting their bodies. Consider the term that would best communicate this idea in your language, or you could state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “those who cut themselves”

**"the circumcision"**

In contrast to its normal usage in the Bible, here Paul uses the term **the circumcision** as a metonym to refer to all true Christians. Normally, the term **the circumcision** was used to refer to Jewish males, all circumcised, but here Paul intentionally uses this term with a spiritual sense to refer to all Christians, both Jews and non\-Jew. This would have been surprising to his readers. Paul’s use of **the circumcision** here refers to the inward, spiritual circumcision that the Holy Spirit performs in the hearts of all true Christians.

**"boasting in Christ Jesus and not being confident in the flesh"**

The phrase **boasting in Christ Jesus** and the phrase **and having no confidence in the flesh** are complementary ideas which express a similar truth. If people truly place their confidence in Christ as their only means of earning God’s favor, they will not put their confidence in themselves or religious acts. Conversely, if people put their confidence in religious rituals and observances, they cannot place their full confidence in Christ.

**""**

Using a type of hypothetical situation, Paul recites his own credentials to illustrate that if observing the law could earn God’s favor, then he had more reason to boast than anyone else. His purpose is to teach the Philippian believers that they should only trust in Christ and not trust in other things to earn God’s favor. Paul explains in [3:7–11](https://ref.ly/Phil3:7-Phil3:11) that his hope is in Christ and not in the things he lists in the next two verses.

**"whose god {is their} belly"**

Here Paul uses **belly** to represent all physical desires for pleasure.

Alternate translation: “who serve their desire for food and other pleasures rather than serve God” or “who obey their physical appetites instead of obeying God” or “who love pleasure more than they love God”

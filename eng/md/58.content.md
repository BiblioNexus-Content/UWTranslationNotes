## Hebrews 1:1 (#1) (id: 258008)

**"In many portions and in many ways long ago"**

Here, the phrase **In many portions** shows that God did not speak just once. Rather, he spoke often throughout the time period called **long ago**. Then, the phrase **in many ways** shows that God used various means and people to speak to the **fathers**. The author uses both of these phrases because he wishes to emphasize the variety of times and ways in which God has **spoken**. If your language does not use repetition for emphasis, and if you cannot represent the author’s two phrases well, you could express the idea using one phrase that emphasizes variety. Alternate translation: “Long ago, with great variety” or “Long ago, using multiple methods in different times,”

## Hebrews 1:1 (#2) (id: 258009)

**"In many portions and in many ways long ago, God, having spoken to our fathers through the prophets"**

Here, the phrase **In many portions and in many ways long ago** describes how God “spoke” **to our fathers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the phrases so that **In many portions and in many ways long ago** does modify **having spoken**.

**"having spoken"**

## Hebrews 1:1 (#4) (id: 258011)

**"to our fathers"**

Here, the phrase **our fathers** refers to the Israelites who were alive before Jesus lived on earth. Not all members of the audience were descended from these Israelites. However, the author can still refer to the Israelites as their **fathers** because he thinks that all Christians have been included in the family of Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites. If possible, preserve the family language in your translation. Alternate translation: “our forefathers” or “to the Israelite ancestors”

## Hebrews 1:2 (#1) (id: 258012)

**"at the last of these days spoke to us through a Son, whom"**

The author uses words and phrases in this clause that make its structure parallel to the previous verse ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1)). He does this to emphasize the contrast between “long ago” and **at the last of these days**. If possible, use the same structures in this clause as you did in the last verse. Alternate translation: “has spoken to us through a Son at the last of these days. This Son is the one whom”

**"he appointed heir of all things"**

Here the author speaks as if Jesus were a child who would receive property passed on by the parent to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus is the **Son** who will “inherit” **all things**, which means that he will rule over everything that exists. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he appointed owner of all things” or “he appointed to be the one who will rule over all things”

**"who, being the brightness of his glory and exact representation of his being, upholding all the things by the word of his power and having made purification for sins, sat down at the right of the Majesty on high"**

Here the author includes a long description of who the “Son” is. The phrases **being the brightness of his glory and exact representation of his being** and **upholding all the things by the word of his power** describe what the “Son” always is and does. The phrase **having made cleansing for sins** refers more specifically to what the “Son” has done and completed before he **sat down at the right hand**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the phrase **having made purification for sins** refers to something that happened before **sat down**, while the previous phrases all refer to things that the “Son” always is and does. Alternate translation: “who is the brightness of his glory and exact representation of his being and who upholds all the things by the word of his power. After having made purification for sins, he sat down at the right of the Majesty on high”

The author speaks in this way to emphasize that the Son “shines” with the **glory** that only God has. He means that the “Son” is God and represents God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the reflection of his glory and” or “one who has the glory of God and the”

**"at the right of the Majesty"**

Here, the phrase **at the right** refers to the place next to a person’s **right** hand, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that the Son has honor and authority when he sits there.

## Hebrews 1:3 (#9) (id: 258025)

**"of the Majesty"**

In the author’s culture, it was considered reverent to avoid saying God’s name. Here the author uses **Majesty** instead of God’s name in order to follow this custom and to indicate that God is powerful and glorious. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a reverent way to refer to God in your culture, especially if it emphasizes how God is powerful and glorious. Alternate translation: “of the great deity” or “of the glorious God”

## Hebrews 1:4 (#2) (id: 258028)

**"having become far superior to the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they"**

Here the author uses a comparison that indicates that the difference in “superiority” between the Son and **the angels** is the same as the difference between the Son’s **name** and the names of **the angels**. Consider clear ways to indicate such a comparison in your language. Alternate translation: “having become as much superior to the angels as the name that he has inherited is more excellent than theirs”

* **Associated Passages:** HEB 1:4

## Hebrews 1:4 (#3) (id: 258029)

**"a more excellent name"**

Here the author does not clarify what **name** this is. It could be the title “Son,” the title “Lord,” the name “Jesus,” or God’s own special name, “Yahweh.” Since the author did not clarify to what **name** he is referring, it is best to refer to a name or title without stating what it is. Alternate translation: “a more excellent title”

## Hebrews 1:4 (#4) (id: 258030)

**"he has inherited"**

Here the author speaks as if Jesus were a child who would receive property that a parent passes on to their heir when the parent dies.

## Hebrews 1:4 (#5) (id: 258031)

**"than they"**

The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He omits these words because he stated them in the first half of the comparison (a **name**). If your language needs these words to make a complete sentence, you could include them here. Alternate translation: “than their names”

**"For"**

Here, the word **For** introduces the support or basis that proves that the Son is “superior to the angels” ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Heb1:4)). The supporting statements that **For** introduces can be found in [1:5–14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support or basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “Here is the proof for that:”

## Hebrews 1:5 (#2) (id: 258033)

**""For to which of the angels did he ever say,"**

The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to both is “none of them,” for God said these words to his own Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas with strong negations. Alternate translation: “For God never said to any of the angels ‘You are my son, and I today I have become your father.’ And again, ‘I will be as a father to him, and he will be as a son to me.”

## Hebrews 1:5 (#3) (id: 258034)

**""For to which of the angels did he ever say,"**

Here the author quotes the Old Testament Scriptures. He does not introduce the quotations as quotations, but instead he introduces them as words that God has spoken to his Son, not to angels. However, the audience would have understood that these were quotations from the Old Testament. The first quotation comes from [Psalm 2:7](https://ref.ly/Ps2:7), and the second quotation comes from [2 Samuel 7:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:14). Since the author introduces these quotations as words that God has said to his Son, not to angels, you should introduce these quotations as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotations are from the Old Testament, you could include footnotes or use some other form to identify the quotations. The phrase **And again** is a normal form that the author uses to connect a second quotation to a first quotation. Alternate translation: “For to which of the angels did he ever speak … And”

## Hebrews 1:5 (#4) (id: 258035)

**""You are my son."**

In their original contexts, these two quotations referred to the king of Israel as one who became God’s **son** when he began to rule. Thus, God was his **father**. When the author applies these words not to angels but to Jesus, he identifies the **father** as God the Father and the **son** as God the Son. He does not mean that Jesus becomes **son** at some point or begins to exist at some point. Rather, he means that God the Father declares and reveals Jesus to be God the Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some words or a footnote that clarifies the meaning. Alternate translation: “You are my son, today I have proclaimed that I am your father … I proclaim that I am his father and that he is my son”

**""You are my son."**

Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **son** language, and the other uses “father” language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “Today I have fathered you, my son”

**"But again"**

Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with the previous verse, which talks about what God has not said to angels. In this verse, the author identifies what God has said to angels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that would introduce this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “Again, and in contrast,”

## Hebrews 1:6 (#2) (id: 258040)

**"But again,"** \- **"he says"**

Here the author quotes from the Old Testament Scriptures. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken to angels about his Son. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from the Greek translation of [Deuteronomy 32:43](https://ref.ly/Deut32:43). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said to the angels, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. The phrase **But again** was a normal way in the author’s culture to introduce another quotation. Alternate translation: “Further … God declares”

## Hebrews 1:6 (#3) (id: 258041)

**"he brings"** \- **"he says"**

Here the author uses the present tense to introduce what God says. He may be referring to a past event (if **brings** refers to the incarnation or the ascension of Jesus) or a future event (if **brings** refers to the return of Jesus at the end). The author uses the present tense to focus on what God **says** rather than when he **says** it. Consider what tense would be appropriate for referring primarily to what a person says. Alternate translation: “he brought … he said”

**"But again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says"**

Here, the word **again** could modify: (1\) **he says**. In this case, **again** tells the audience that the author is quoting an important text **again**. Alternate translation: “But, when he brings the firstborn into the world, again he says” (2\) **he brings**. In this case, **again** tells the audience that the **firstborn** has already been in **the world**, and God is “bringing” him into it **again**. The “bringing” would then refer to how Jesus returns to heaven when he ascends or how he comes back again to earth at the end. Alternate translation: “But, when he again brings the firstborn into the world, he says”

**"the firstborn"**

Here, the phrase **the firstborn** refers to Jesus. The author refers to him as the **firstborn** to emphasize his importance and authority over everyone else. It does not imply that there was a time before Jesus existed or that God gave birth to him at some point. Rather, it implies that Jesus has adopted siblings; they are everyone who believes in him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his honored Son” or “his first Son”

Here, the phrase **the world** could refer to: (1\) the “world that is coming” (See: [2:5](https://ref.ly/Heb2:5)), which is heaven or the heavenly world. In this case, the verse refers to Jesus’ ascension into heaven. Alternate translation: “into the coming world” (2\) this world as it currently exists. In this case, the verse refers either to Jesus’ incarnation or to his return to earth at the end. Alternate translation: “into our world”

**"And on the one hand, with regard to the angels, he says"**

Here the author quotes from the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken about angels. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from the Greek translation of [Psalm 104:4](https://ref.ly/Ps104:4). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about the angels, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation.

**"The one making his"** \- **"his"**

Here the author has God speaking about himself in the third person. He uses this form because the quotation uses the third person to speak about God, and the author claims that God speaks the quotation.

**"But on the other hand"**

Here, the phrase **But on the other hand** introduces a contrast with what God said about the angels in [1:7](https://ref.ly/Heb1:7). The author contrasts the fact that God has created the angels with how the **Son** rules forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “However, on the other hand,”

However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 45:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ps45:6-Ps45:7).

**""as a cloak you will roll them up,"**

Here the author continues to compare the heavens and earth to clothing, in this case a **cloak** or a **garment**. Both of these words refer to outer clothing. Both similes describe what a person would do with a dirty or old piece of clothing. They would change out of it, and they would **roll** it up to wash it or throw it away. The author of the quotation uses this simile to show that God will remove and replace what he has created as easily as a person changes out of an outer garment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable simile or express the idea plainly.

Here the author speaks as if believers were children who would receive property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that believers receive **salvation** from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to receive salvation from God” or “to be given salvation by God”

**"Because of this"**

Here the author introduces a result or implication from what he said about the Son and the angels in [1:1–14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:14). Because God now speaks through his Son, who is greater than the angels, the audience needs to **give attention**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that draws an inference from the previous chapter. Alternate translation: “Because God is speaking through his Son” or “Because of all that”

**"so that we might not drift away {from them"**

Here the author speaks as if the audience were boats that could **drift away** from where they were moored. In this metaphor, the place where the boats are moored is the good news about Jesus, and “drifting away” from this place refers to slowly failing to believe this good news. The author uses this metaphor to encourage the audience to remain “moored” to the good news by continuing to focus on it and firmly believe it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly.

The word **disobedience** refers to when someone hears a law or command and ignores it. The author uses both words to emphasize that any kind of law\-breaking was punished. If you do not have words that represent these two ideas, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could express the idea with a single word or phrase.

The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing.

The word **signs** emphasizes that these acts reveal something; the word **wonders** emphasizes that these acts are amazing or unusual; the word **miracles** emphasizes that these acts are powerful. The author uses these three words to show that God uses lots of things to “testify” to the truth of the message about salvation. If your language does not have different words that emphasize these three aspects of the supernatural acts, you could combine two or all three of these words into one word or phrase and emphasize the variety of testimonies in another way.

He intentionally uses vague words to introduce the quotation, and he does not identify who wrote the words or where they could be found. The quotation comes from [Psalm 8:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps8:4-Ps8:6). Since the author intentionally avoids giving information about where the quotation comes from, you should not include such information in your translation.

The author does not include this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he includes it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “nothing,” for nothing about **man** or a **son of man** is significant enough for God to **remember** or **watch over** him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negation.

While he goes on to identify Jesus as the only human who currently fulfills these words (See: [2:9](https://ref.ly/Heb2:9)), he intends the words first of all to refer to humans in general. Alternate translation: “a human … him or her … a child of a human … him or her” (2\) Jesus, who calls himself a **son of man**. In this case, you should preserve the singular and masculine language.

**"a son of man"**

In the culture of the quotation’s author, the phrase **son of man** was a way to refer to a person who was descended from other humans. In other words, it is another way to say **man** or “human.” Jesus used this phrase to refer to himself during his earthly life, so it is possible that the author of Hebrews intended **son of man** to refer to Jesus directly. However, the author never uses **son of man** to refer to Jesus anywhere else. If it would be helpful in your language, you could: (1\) use a word or phrase that refers to humans in general.

While he may have believed that this was true in terms of spatial placement, since **angels** live in heaven “above” and humans live on earth “below,” the point is primarily about status and power. Being **lower** means that humans have less status and power than angels.

However, the quotation itself suggests that humans have a place that is **a little** lower. If that is true, then the author later uses **a little** to refer to time in a play on words.

However, most likely the author did not include this clause because it was not important to the point he is making.

## Hebrews 2:9 (#1) (id: 258154)

**"the one made a little lower than the angels"**

Here the author refers to how Jesus was **lower than the angels**. While he may have believed that this was true in terms of spatial placement, since angels live in heaven “above” and Jesus lived on earth “below,” the point is primarily about status and power. Being **lower** means that **Jesus** had less status and power than the **angels**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that describes how **Jesus** had less status and power than **angels** during his incarnate life. See how you translated this clause in [2:7](https://ref.ly/Heb2:7). Alternate translation: “who had a little less status than the angels” or “who was a little less important than the angels”

**"a little"**

Here, the phrase **a little** could refer primarily to place or to time. Here, it is likely that the author uses the phrase to show that Jesus was lower than the angels for **a little** time. However, the phrase in the quotation in [2:7](https://ref.ly/Heb2:7) suggested that humans have a place that is **a little** lower. If that is true, then the author uses the same phrase that referred to place in the quotation, but he uses it to refer to time. You could express **a little** so that it refers to: (1\) time. Alternate translation: “for a little while” (2\) place. Alternate translation: “a little bit”

## Hebrews 2:15 (#1) (id: 258201)

**"might release those {people}, as many as, in fear of death throughout all their lives, were held in slavery"**

Here the author speaks as if the **fear of death** were something that could hold people in **slavery**. Taking away this **fear** is thus “releasing” those people from **slavery**. The author speaks in this way to emphasize how controlling and powerful is the **fear of death** and how Jesus completely takes away the power that this **fear** can hold. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “might free those people, as many as, in fear of death throughout all their lives, were held tightly” or “might help those people, as many as continually lived in fear of death throughout all their lives”

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **held in slavery** rather than on the person doing the holding.

**"he does not take hold of"** \- **"he takes hold of"**

Here, the phrase **take hold of** could refer to: (1\) how someone **takes** someone by the hand or the shoulder and leads them where they need to go. The author speaks in this way to refer to how someone helps or takes care of other people. Alternate translation: “he does not assist … he assists” (2\) how someone **takes** someone else’s specific nature or kind.

## Hebrews 2:16 (#5) (id: 258209)

**"the offspring of Abraham"**

Here, the phrase **offspring of Abraham** refers to those who are descended from **Abraham**, which are the Israelites or Jews. However, the author applies a promise made to **Abraham** to his audience, whether they were Jews or not (See: [6:13–20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:20)). Because of this, he thinks that each person who believes in Jesus receives the promise and is a **offspring of Abraham**. In your translation, make it clear that **offspring** is not just about physical descendants but rather about who belongs in Abraham’s family, whether they were born in that family or not.

**"the confidence and the boasting of our hope"**

Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **confidence** and **boasting** about or concerning **our hope**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural construction. Alternate translation: “the confidence and the boasting concerning our hope”

## Hebrews 3:7 (#2) (id: 258255)

**"just as the Holy Spirit says"**

Here and in the next four verses, the author quotes from the Old Testament. The audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 95:7–11](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7-Ps95:11), which refers to a story that can be found in [Numbers 14:1–38](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:38). See the chapter introduction for more information about this story. Since the author introduces this quotation as words that the **Holy Spirit says**, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “as says the Holy Spirit”

**"if"**

Here the author is speaking as if “hearing his voice” were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “when.” Alternate translation: “whenever”

**"do not harden your hearts"**

When someone “hardens their heart,” it means that they become stubborn and refuse to listen or respond to someone else.

**""as in the provocation,"**

While the quotation primarily refers to the story about how the Israelites did not enter the land that God promised them (See: [Numbers 14:1–38](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:38)), there is another story that the author of the quotation may be referring to. In [Exodus 17:1–7](https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:7), the Israelites are thirsty while they are in the **wilderness**, and they “provoke” and “test” God by complaining. God provides water for them, and Moses names one of the places where they were **testing**” (See: [Exodus 17:7](https://ref.ly/Exod17:7)). It is quite possible that the author of the quotation is thinking about this story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information or use a footnote to refer to the stories. Alternate translation: “as when the Israelite ancestors provoked God during the day in which they tested him in the wilderness”

Here, the words **tested** and **examination** refer to basically the same thing. The word **tested** refers to the act of “testing,” while **examination** refers to the “test” itself. The author of the quotation uses both words to emphasize how the **fathers** “examined” God. If the repetition would be confusing, and if using both words is not emphatic in your language, you could express the idea with one word or phrase. Alternate translation: “examined me”

**"which ones, having heard, provoked {him}? {Was it} not all the ones having come out from Egypt through Moses"**

The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The second question gives the answer to the first question: “it was those who came out from Egypt through Moses.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a form that identifies those **who heard** and **provoked** with **all those who came out from Egypt through Moses**.

**"with whom was he very angry for 40 years? {Was it} not with the ones having sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness"**

The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The second question gives the answer to the first question: “It was those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a form that identifies those **with whom he was very angry** with **those who sinned**. Alternate translation: “you know who they are with whom he was very angry for 40 years. It was those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness.” or “with whom was he very angry for 40 years? It was with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness.”

The phrase **corpses fell** refers to people dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that refers to people dying.

The author’s point is that **they** received the promise of rest, but they did not receive rest, because they disobeyed. Since **we** are in the same situation and have also received the promise of rest, we need to “be afraid” that what happened to **them** will happen to **us**.

In this case, the clause would refer to how **those who heard** the message did not join **faith** to it when they heard it. In other words, they did not believe what they heard. However, the option that the ULT follows has the most support, so it is best to make **not having been joined** refer back to **them**.

However, the quotation is a negative statement about how the Israelite ancestors will not **enter into rest**. The quotation could support the claim by: (1\) proving the opposite point. Since the Israelite ancestors did not enter because they did not believe (See: [3:19](https://ref.ly/Heb3:19)), that means that those who believe can enter. Alternate translation: “which you know because he said this about those who did not believe:” (2\) proving that the **rest** is still available.

The author’s point is that God’s oath about how the Israelite ancestors would never **enter** does not mean that the **rest** is not available or not yet available. Instead, the **rest** has been available since God created everything. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit.

However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, specifically from [Genesis 2:2](https://ref.ly/Gen2:2). This passage tells the story of how God created everything in six days and then rested on the seventh day. Since the author introduces the quotation as words that someone has spoken, you should do the same. The word **somewhere** shows that the words come from Scriptures without stating exactly where. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation.

Here, the word **again** indicates that the Holy Spirit had already “set” a **day** and now does it for a second time. The first time was when God promised the “rest” to the Israelite ancestors. The second time (**again**) was when the Spirit spoke the quote from Psalm 95 **through David**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to doing something “once more” or “for a second time.” Alternate translation: “for a second time”

**"calling it “Today"**

Here the author speaks about a time that we call **Today**. We call every day **Today**, so this phrase means that the rest is available right now. However, since the author uses **Today** because the author of the quotation uses it, make sure that you use the same words that you used to translate **Today** in [3:7](https://ref.ly/Heb3:7). Alternate translation: “calling it ‘This day’”

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the words that have **been said** rather than on the person doing the saying.

**"if Joshua gave them rest"**

Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that **Joshua** did not give the Israelite ancestors the kind of **rest** he is discussing. He proves that the conditional statement is not true by showing that it would contradict what is true: the Holy Spirit did actually speak **about another day**, as the previous verse shows.

The author does not mean that there is only one period of 24 hours during which people can “enter the rest.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a specific point in time.

Here, the phrase **these things** refers to what happened when **Joshua** was leading the Israelite ancestors. He guided them into the land that God had promised to give them, and he led them as they fought their enemies and then settled in that land. The author’s point is that, since David speaks about entering the **rest** much later than this, the events related to **Joshua** must not count as getting **rest**.

His point is that the **word** can separate things that are hard to separate, just like a very sharp **sword** can.

However, the author is not primarily interested in what parts of the person to which these two words refer. Rather, he is focused on how **soul** and **spirit** always go together, and it is difficult to “divide” them.

Many people in the author’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual **heavens**. Paul speaks this way in [2 Corinthians 12:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:2). Here, the author uses this language without clarifying how many **heavens** there are. The main point is that Jesus **passed through** these **heavens** to where God dwells. Often, this place where God dwells is in the highest of the **heavens**. Since the author does not include details about the **heavens**, translate **heavens** with a word or phrase that refers to all of heavenly space, including the idea of multiple **heavens** if possible.

Here the author further explains the metaphor about **milk** that he introduced in the previous verse (See: [5:12](https://ref.ly/Heb5:12)). He identifies the one **who partakes of milk** as a person who is **inexperienced** and thus **an infant**. The point is that the people who fit this description are those who only know very little about God and are unable or unwilling to learn more, just like an **infant** is unable to feed on anything besides **milk**.

He speaks in this way to encourage his audience to focus more time and energy on the destination (**maturity**) than on where they started out (**the beginning of the message**). He does not want them to replace **the beginning of the message** with what is related to **maturity**. Rather, he is exhorting them about what to focus their time and energy on.

**"as an anchor of the soul, both reliable and confirmed"**

Here the author states that “hope” functions **as an anchor for the soul**. Just like an **anchor** holds a ship in one place so that it does not drift away (See: the chapter introduction), so “hope,” which is **both reliable and confirmed**, holds **the soul** in one place so that the person persists in trusting God and hoping for what he has promised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to something else that holds things in place, or you could express the idea plainly.

In other words, while we cannot “enter” that place, we can confidently expect to receive and experience what is in that place.

Four **kings** conquered a city in which Abraham’s nephew was living, and they captured his nephew. Abraham took the fighting men that he had, and he conquered and “slaughtered” the armies of these four **kings**. He recovered all the valuable things that these **kings** had taken, including his nephew. When he was going back home after defeating the **kings**, he met **Melchizedek**. If your readers would need to know more about this background than the author states explicitly, you could include some extra information in your translation, or you could use a footnote to explain the story.

Here the author is describing the character “Melchizedek” as he appears in [Genesis 14:18–20](https://ref.ly/Gen14:18-Gen14:20). The author of that story does not mention anything about Melchizedek’s parents, how old he was, when he was born, or when he died. This is unusual, especially since priests usually needed to be the children of priests. The author of Hebrews probably did not think that Melchizedek was a supernatural being. Instead, he uses the character “Melchizedek” from the Old Testament story to help his audience understand Jesus better. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is referring to what the Old Testament tells us about Melchizedek.

The author explicitly contrasts **mortal men** and **he lives on**. He does not explicitly restate the fact that Melchizedek too receives **tithes**, but he does imply it.

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on Melchizedek who **is testified about** rather than on the person doing the testifying.

The author of that story does not mention anything about Melchizedek’s death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is referring to what the Old Testament tells us about Melchizedek.

**"he was still in the loin of his father"**

Here the author speaks as if Levi **was still in the loin of his father**. He means that Abraham had not yet fathered any descendants, so in a way they were all still part of Abraham. The author uses this figure of speech to make two points. First, Levi and the priests descended from him had not yet been born and thus could be considered to be inside Abraham. Second, because they were inside Abraham, they participated in whatever Abraham did. This included giving a tithe to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that closely identifies Levi and Abraham, while showing that Levi was not yet born.

Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that **perfection** did not happen **through the Levitical priesthood**. He proves that the conditional statement is not true by reminding the audience that God did indeed appoint **another priest** who is **according to the order of Melchizedek**.

The question implies that the answer is “there was no further need.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation.

## Hebrews 7:13 (#3) (id: 258650)

**"about whom these things are said"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **said** rather than on the person doing the saying. If you must state who did the “saying,” the author implies that God did it in the words of [110:4](https://ref.ly/Ps110:4). Alternate translation: “about whom God said these things” or “about whom we read these things in the psalm”

Here, the phrase **tribe** refers to all those people who are descended from one of Jacob’s twelve sons. The author refers to **another tribe** to show that Jesus is not from the **tribe** of Levi. He will state which tribe Jesus is from in the next verse, so do not identify of whose **tribe** the author speaks until the next verse.

**"it is} obvious"**

Here, the phrase **{it is} obvious** indicates that what follows is common knowledge, that is, information that the author assumes his audience already knows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that introduces common knowledge. Alternate translation: “everyone knows” or “it is commonly known”

**"has sprung up from Judah"**

Here the author describes Jesus’ birth as if he were the sun that “sprang up” above the horizon at sunrise. He speaks in this way to refer to Jesus’ birth as a descendant of **Judah** but also to indicate that Jesus’ birth was not completely normal. Since Jesus was born by the power of the Holy Spirit without a human father, the author uses a less common phrase to refer to the person from whom he is descended. If possible, use a comparable phrase in your language that refers to human descent but that also indicates that Jesus’ birth was not totally normal.

**"And this is still even more obvious"**

Here, the phrase **still even more obvious** is a stronger form of the phrase “{it is} obvious” in [7:14](https://ref.ly/Heb7:14). The author’s point is that everyone must acknowledge that **this** (See: the previous note) is true, given that the following **if** statement is also true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that everyone must agree with.

Alternate translation: “For indeed they, without swearing an oath, are become priests, but he with an oath\-taking, through God saying to him, “The Lord swore and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’” So, by as much as not without swearing an oath,”

## Hebrews 7:21 (#7) (id: 258698)

**"You {are} a priest forever"**

Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [7:17](https://ref.ly/Heb7:17) (although he does not include the phrase “according to the order of Melchizedek”), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.

## Hebrews 7:22 (#1) (id: 258699)

**"according to so much more"**

Here, the phrase **according to so much more** introduces the second half of the comparison that the author began in the first part of [7:20](https://ref.ly/Heb7:20). The comparison indicates that the difference in greatness between a priesthood with an oath and a priesthood without an oath is comparable to the difference in greatness between the covenants of which these priesthoods are a part. In other words, the covenant that Jesus “guarantees” is greater than the covenant that God gave through Moses, just like his priesthood that is guaranteed by an oath is greater than the priesthood that God gave to the descendants of Levi. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that expresses a comparison between two situations or concepts. Alternate translation: “by that much” or “by so much”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “of a covenant that is better than the covenant that God gave through Moses”

**"And the ones, on the one hand, having become"**

Here, the word **And** indicates that the author is adding a new point or topic to what he is discussing. The phrase **on the one hand** signals to the reader that this new point occurs in two contrasting parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that more clearly introduce a new point in two contrasting parts. Make sure that you express the second half of the contrast in [7:24](https://ref.ly/Heb7:24) so that it fits with what you do here. Alternate translation: “Now on the one hand, the ones having become” or “First, the ones having become”

**"holy, innocent, pure"**

The three words **holy**, **innocent**, and **pure** mean very similar things and emphasize that Jesus did not sin or do anything wrong. The word **holy** emphasizes how Jesus honored and pleased God. The word **innocent** identifies Jesus as a person who did not think about or plan evil deeds. The word **pure** indicates that Jesus did not do anything that would defile him or make him repulsive to God. If your language does not have words that fit with these three distinct ideas, you could express these three words with one or two words or with a phrase.

## Hebrews 7:26 (#5) (id: 258716)

**"having become higher than the heavens"**

Many people in the author’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. The author has already used the plural **heavens** in [4:14](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14). Here, the author uses this language without clarifying how many heavens there are. The main point is that Jesus is **higher than the heavens**. This could mean that: (1\) Jesus is in the highest heaven, **higher** than all the other **heavens**. Alternate translation: “having come to the highest place in the heavens” (2\) Jesus has gone beyond all the **heavens**. This could be a metaphor for how greatly God has honored him, or it could mean that Jesus has left the creation. Alternate translation: “having become more exalted than the heavens” or “having gone beyond the heavens”

**"a man"**

Although the word **man** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to any human, whether male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that applies to both men and women, or you could refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “a man or woman”

Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what the author has said in [8:1–2](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1-Heb8:2) about how Christ is a high priest. This explanation continues in the following verses and compares and contrasts Christ with the Levitical priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated.

**"every high priest is appointed"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **appointed** rather than on the person doing the appointing. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that God did it.

**"both gifts and sacrifices"**

Here, the words **gifts** and **sacrifices** function together to refer to anything that an Israelite would have offered to God. It is probable that **sacrifices** refers to animals that would be killed and offered to God, while **gifts** identifies anything else that a person would give to God. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to what an Israelite would offer to God.

**"Now"**

Here, the word **Now** introduces an inference based on the claim that priests offer **gifts and sacrifices** ([8:3](https://ref.ly/Heb8:3)). The author’s point is that God has already set up a priesthood **on earth** that offers the necessary **gifts**. Because Jesus does not belong to that priesthood (since he is not descended from Levi), he is not **a priest** on earth, but only in heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or a development. Alternate translation: “As you can see,” or “Therefore,”

**"if indeed he were on earth"**

Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that Jesus is not really **on earth** right now. He uses the statement that he knows is not true to show that Jesus can only be a high priest in heaven and not on earth.

Here the author does not mean that Jesus was never **on earth** or will never be **on earth**. Rather, he means that Jesus is not **on earth** right now, because he has ascended into heaven (See: [8:1](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1)).

**"since} there are the ones offering the gifts according to the law"**

Here, the phrase **{since} there are** introduces the reason why Jesus **would not be a priest at all** if he were **on earth** right now. The author’s point is that God has already appointed priests who serve on earth and Jesus is not one of them. Therefore, he is not a priest **on earth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the phrase **{since} there are the ones offering** gives the reason for the author’s claim.

Moses then told the Israelites how to **complete the tabernacle**. You can read the instructions that God gave to Moses about the tabernacle and its service in [Exodus 25–30](https://ref.ly/Exod0:0).

This altar was coated in “gold.” You can read about the **golden incense altar** in [Exodus 30:1–10](https://ref.ly/Exod30:1-Exod30:10). Use a phrase that refers to a structure or object that someone would use to offer things to God. Alternate translation: “a sacred table for burning incense, covered in gold,”

Alternate translation: “of the blessings” or “of the good gifts”

## Hebrews 9:11 (#4) (id: 258894)

**"having come into existence"**

Instead of the phrase **that have come into existence**, many ancient manuscripts have the phrase “that are coming”. The phrase that the ULT uses identifies the **good things** as things that believers already have, while the phrase “that are coming” identifies the **good things** as things that believers are still waiting for. The majority of scholars think that the phrase in the ULT is the correct one. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

**"greater and more perfect"**

Here, the words **greater** and **more perfect** function together to identify the heavenly **tabernacle** as superior to the earthly one. It is probable that **greater** identifies the heavenly **tabernacle** as more important, while **more perfect** identifies it as more able to accomplish what it was intended to do. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to identify the heavenly **tabernacle** as more important and effective than the earthly one.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. This could mean: (1\) that it belongs to the heavenly world, that is, it is not of this creation but of another creation.

He would present the **blood** to God and then apply it to various parts of the sanctuary, the altar, and the ark. In this verse, the author contrasts how those priests presented **blood** from animals with how Jesus presented **his own blood**.

**"having himself obtained eternal redemption"**

When the author says that Jesus **obtained eternal redemption** for his people, he is speaking as if Jesus literally paid a price to free them from someone or something that owned or controlled them. He means that Jesus has obtained forgiveness for his people’s sins and forever kept those sins from controlling them. Though he speaks as if Jesus paid a price, the author’s emphasis here is particularly on how Jesus freed his people from sin. This is an important biblical image, and so you may wish to preserve the metaphor in your translation even if your language does not ordinarily use figures of speech. Alternatively, you could express it as a comparison. Alternate translation: “as if he had paid a price to set his people free from sin forever”

In this ceremony, a priest would offer and burn a **heifer**, and the priests would mix the ashes with water and sprinkle it on people who had become unclean.

Here, the phrase **cleansing of their flesh** is intended to contrast with the phrase “cleanse your conscience” in [9:14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:14). The author’s point is that what the Levitical priests did could effectively cleanse only the **flesh** or outer parts of a person. In contrast, Jesus’ work cleanses the “conscience” or inner part of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to external or partial **cleansing**.

**"not even the first {covenant} had been inaugurated without blood"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **first {covenant}** that was **inaugurated** rather than on the person doing the inaugurating. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that God did it through Moses (See: [9:19](https://ref.ly/Heb9:19)).

**"every command having been spoken according to the law by Moses to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and red wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people"**

Here the author assumes that his audience will be familiar with a story from the Old Testament. In this story, Moses spoke **the law** and then sprinkled the people with **blood**. You can read the story in [Exodus 24:1–8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1-Exod24:8). In these verses, the Israelites agreed to follow the law and keep the covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that the author is speaking about how Moses cleansed the people when they heard and agreed to the covenant with God. It may be helpful to make this more than one sentence. Alternate translation: “every command having been spoken according to the law by Moses to all the people, they agreed to keep the commands. Then, Moses took the blood of calves and goats that had been sacrificed, and he mixed it with water and red wool and hyssop. Then, he sprinkled both the scroll of the law itself and all the people with the mixture”

**"with water and red wool and hyssop"**

When the author describes how Moses used **red wool** and **hyssop**, he could be referring to the instructions for cleansing a person from a skin disease, which you can find in [Leviticus 14:1–7](https://ref.ly/Lev14:1-Lev14:7). However, it is more likely that the author is referring to the **red wool** and **hyssop** that the priest burned along with a “heifer” to make “ashes” that could be mixed with water and used for cleansing. You can read about this ritual in [Numbers 19:1–10](https://ref.ly/Num19:1-Num19:10); the author has already mentioned it in [9:13](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13). The author’s point here is that when Moses cleansed the people when they agreed to the covenant, the law indicated that cleansing would require **blood**, **water**, **red wool**, and **hyssop**. Alternate translation: “with water and red wool and hyssop, as the Law required”

These were not the only animals that could be sacrificed, and the story about Moses speaking the commands only mentions **bulls**.

**"with water and red wool and hyssop"**

Here the author does not state how **Moses** used the **water**, **red wool**, and **hyssop**. The story in [Exodus 24:1–8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1-Exod24:8) mentions that Moses mixed the blood with **water**, but it does not mention the other two things. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate how Moses used them. The author may be implying that: (1\) Moses tied stalks of **hyssop** plants together with the **red wool** to create a brush that he used to sprinkle the **blood** and **water**. That is what **hyssop** and **red wool** are used for in [Leviticus 14:1–7](https://ref.ly/Lev14:1-Lev14:7). Alternate translation: “mixing it with water and dipping hyssop tied with red wool in it” (2\) Moses burned the **red wool** and **hyssop** and mixed them in with the **blood** and **water**. That is what **hyssop** and **red wool** are used for in [Numbers 19:1–10](https://ref.ly/Num19:1-Num19:10). Alternate translation: “mixing it with water and ashes from red wool and hyssop”

## Hebrews 9:25 (#4) (id: 258987)

**"with blood {that is} not his own"**

Here, the **blood** is **not his own** because it comes from an animal that someone has sacrificed. The author expresses the idea in this way because he is contrasting the **high priest** with Jesus, who did offer his own blood (See: [9:12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “with another being’s blood” or “with blood from an animal”

## Hebrews 9:26 (#1) (id: 258988)

**"since it was necessary for"**

Here the author does not directly state the basis for his inference (**since**). Instead, he implies that it is a positive version of the negative statement “not in order to offer himself many times” in [9:25](https://ref.ly/Heb9:25). In other words, the point is that Christ could not make an offering many times, **since** then it would be **necessary for him to suffer many times**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of the implied words to make the idea clearer. Alternate translation: “since if he had offered himself many times, it would have been necessary for” or “since otherwise it would have been necessary for”

**"But now"**

Here, the phrase **But now** could introduce (1\) a contrast to the hypothetical situation the author offered in the first half of the verse. In this case, the word **now** does not refer to time but identifies what is actually true. See the similar construction in [8:6](https://ref.ly/Heb8:6), which contrasts with the hypothetical situation in [8:4](https://ref.ly/Heb8:4). Alternate translation: “In reality, though,” or “As it really is,” (2\) a contrast with the hypothetical situation earlier in the verse and between the past (what the priests did) and the present (**now**). In this case, the word **now** does refer to time. Alternate translation: “But in the present”

The **whole burnt {offering}** refers to how a cow, goat, sheep, or bird would be killed and then completely burned before God. The **concerning sin {offering}** refers to how a bull, goat, lamb, or birds would be killed and the blood from the animal would be sprinkled in specific places. The author refers to both types of offerings in order to refer in general to sacrifices related to sin and atoning for that sin. If you do not have two descriptions for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to what an Israelite would offer to God to take care of sin. Alternate translation: “in sacrifices concerning sin” or “in animals that people offer to deal with sins”

## Hebrews 10:6 (#2) (id: 259036)

**"concerning sin {offerings"**

The author assumes that his audience will understand that by **concerning sin {offerings}**, he means a specific type of sacrifice that people would offer when they sinned. An important part of this offering was how the priest sprinkled blood from the animal in specific places within the tabernacle. You can read about this offering in [Leviticus 4:1–5:13](https://ref.ly/Lev4:1-Lev5:13). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that describes sacrifices offered to deal with sin. Alternate translation: “sin offerings” or “offerings to take away sin”

**""Their sins and their lawless deeds"**

These words are part of the quotation from [31:34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:34) that the author already quoted in [8:12](https://ref.ly/Heb8:12).

**"we receive the full knowledge of the truth"**

**"a sacrifice on behalf of sins no longer remains"**

Here the author means that, once Christ has offered himself as a sacrifice, there are no other effective offerings (See: [10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:18)). Further, Christ has offered himself “once,” so he will not do so again. Because other offerings do not take away **sins** and because Christ will not offer himself again, **a sacrifice on behalf of sins no longer remains**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no sacrifice can take away our sins any longer” or “there are no longer any sacrifices to take away sins”

The word **consume** is a normal word for what **fire** does to things when it burns them. Scholars debate whether the author thought that God’s punishment of his enemies would actually include **fire** or not.

Here the author is referring to [Deuteronomy 17:2–7](https://ref.ly/Deut17:2-Deut17:7), which provides regulations concerning people who completely reject God’s covenant and worship other gods. The specific phrasing here comes from [17:6](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6). The phrase **without mercy** probably comes from [13:8](https://ref.ly/Deut13:8), which similarly refers to how people who participate in idolatry should be put to death.

Here the author uses a long exclamation to emphasize **how much worse** the **punishment** will be for the people he describes in this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as a strong positive statement or as a rhetorical question. Alternate translation: “So you know that certainly much worse punishment will deserve the one having trampled underfoot the Son of God and having considered the blood of the covenant—by which he was sanctified—as profane and having insulted the Spirit of grace.” or “How much worse punishment do you think will deserve the one having trampled underfoot the Son of God and having considered the blood of the covenant—by which he was sanctified—as profane and having insulted the Spirit of grace?”

**"the one having said, “"** \- **"And again"**

## Hebrews 10:37 (#2) (id: 259184)

**"For"**

Here the author uses the word **For** to introduce a quotation from the Old Testament, which continues in the following verse. This quotation supports what he has said about how the audience needs “endurance” (See: [10:37](https://ref.ly/Heb10:37)). The quotation is from [Habakkuk 2:3–4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:3-Hab2:4), although the author rearranges some clauses in the following verse. Further, the phrase **yet {in} a very little {while}** paraphrases the beginning of [2:3](https://ref.ly/Hab2:3), and it sounds much like part of [26:20](https://ref.ly/Isa26:20). However, the author introduces these words as one quotation, so you should also do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is quoting from an important text.

Here the author refers to a story about a man named **Enoch**. Because he pleased God, God did not let him die but instead took him to heaven. You can read about **Enoch** in [Genesis 5:21–24](https://ref.ly/Gen5:21-Gen5:24). You might want to include this information in a footnote.

**"By faith Enoch was transferred"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Enoch**, who **was transferred**, rather than on the person doing the transferring. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that God did it. Alternate translation: “By Enoch’s faith, God transferred him”

The author is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. The word **their** indicates that these **dead** people belong to the families of the **Women**.

**"others were tortured"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who **were tortured** rather than on the people doing the torturing. If you must state who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject.

**"not accepting their release"**

Here the audience would understand that the “torture” would stop if the people being **tortured** did what the torturer asked. In this case, the author implies that the people are being **tortured** to make them disobey or deny God. To “accept release,” then, would require disobeying or denying God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what the author implies more explicit. Alternate translation: “refusing to disobey God in order to be released” or “not being willing to be released by denying God”

**"in sheepskins {and} in goatskins"**

Here, the words **sheepskins** and **goatskins** refer to skins from animals. In the author’s culture, clothing was not made from animal skins but from the fur from the animals. So, people who wore “skins” were not able to get normal clothes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify what wearing **sheepskins** and **goatskins** would mean.

The author puts the clause **of which {people} the world was not worthy** here to contrast with how these same **{people}** are “destitute, oppressed, mistreated” (See: [11:37](https://ref.ly/Heb11:37)). If possible, retain this clause where it stands. If keeping the clause here is not possible, you could move it to the end of the verse.

He means that God acts in ways that cause his “sons” pain, but he does this to train and discipline them.

**"illegitimate and not his sons"**

Here, the words **illegitimate** and **not his sons** function together to identify children who do not have the status of **sons**. In the author’s culture, an **illegitimate** child had one parent who was not fully recognized as a spouse. For example, the woman might not be married to the man, or one of the parents might not be a citizen of the city or country, or one parent might be a slave or concubine. In each of these cases, the child would not receive the full status of “son” and would thus be **illegitimate**. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to identify a child who does not have full status or honor.

On the other hand, the author could be referring to [3:6](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6), which describes how Moses “trembled” when God appeared to him in a burning bush. Most likely, the author is simply describing Moses’ reaction to what he experienced without quoting directly from any Old Testament passage. Introduce the quotation as words that Moses said, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could include a footnote that references one or both of the passages that the quotation could refer to.

If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase that refers to people who have improper sex.

However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament. The words do not exactly match any verse in the Greek translation of the Old Testament that we have, but they are very close to the words found in [31:6](https://ref.ly/Deut31:6), [8](https://ref.ly/Heb13:8).

**"I will never leave you, nor never will I forsake you"**

These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will never leave you; indeed, never will I forsake you”

**"never"** \- **"nor never"**

The words translated **never** are two negative words in both places. In the author’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would think that the two negatives form a positive, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. The word **nor** before the second occurrence of **never** makes the statement even more strongly negative. If your language can use two negatives as the author’s culture did, you could use double negatives here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one strong negative word, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “certainly not … and most certainly not”

**"but} the bodies of these {animals} are burned up"**

If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **bodies** that are **burned** rather than on the person doing the burning. If you must state who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “but a person burns up the bodies of these animals”

However, the author does not identify any city directly, so you should use a general term for a **city** in your language. Alternate translation: “any lasting town”

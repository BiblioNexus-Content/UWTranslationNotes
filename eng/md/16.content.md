## Nehemiah - Introduction (id: 718672)

Introduction to Nehemiah
========================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of Nehemiah

1. Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem and inspects the walls (1:1–2:20\)
2. The people rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (3:1–4:23\)
3. Nehemiah helps the poor and provides an unselfish example (5:1–19\)
4. Enemies try to slow down the work, but the people finish the walls (6:1–19\)
5. Nehemiah lists the people who returned from exile (7:6–73\)
6. Ezra reads the law of Yahweh and the people respond (8:1–10:39\)
7. Nehemiah lists the people who lived in and around Jerusalem (11:1–36\)
8. Nehemiah lists the priests and Levites (12:1–26\)
9. The people dedicate the walls of Jerusalem (12:27–47\)
10. Nehemiah corrects problems (13:1–31\)

### What is the Book of Nehemiah about?

A Jew named Nehemiah lived in Persia and worked for King Artaxerxes. Nehemiah received a report that the walls around Jerusalem were broken down. Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city walls. The walls around the city helped protect the city against armies and invaders.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

The Book of Nehemiah is named for a Jewish leader named Nehemiah. Translators can use the traditional title “Nehemiah.” Or they may choose a more complete title, such as “The Book about Nehemiah.” (See: How to Translate Names)

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?

Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners. He knew this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: False God)

### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?

Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the Promised Land. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done. (See: Promised Land)

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### How does the Book of Nehemiah use the term “Israel”?

The Book of Nehemiah uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God had allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile around 275 years earlier. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: Israel)

### Are the events in the Book of Nehemiah told in the order that they actually happened?

Some of the events in the Book of Nehemiah are told in an order that is different than the order in which they actually happened so that they events can be grouped by theme. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of chronological order.

## Nehemiah - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 718673)

Nehemiah 1 General Notes
========================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

### “The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:”

This phrase serves as an introduction to this entire book.

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Repentance

This chapter is a single long record of Nehemiah’s repentance on behalf of the people of Israel. (See: Repent)

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### I

In this book, the word “I” always refers to Nehemiah.

### Israel

In this book, “Israel” probably does not refer to the northern kingdom of Israel. Neither does it likely refer to the twelve tribes of Israel. Instead, it is probably a reference to Israel in the sense of the surviving people group from the southern kingdom of Judah. At Nehemiah’s time, these would be the people from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin who survived the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BC and the exile of many of them to Babylon. The other tribes had already been scattered throughout the entire Near East where most of them lost their identity as Israel.

## Nehemiah 1:1 (#5) (id: 272440)

**"in Susa the citadel"**

A **citadel** is a fortified castle or palace, usually inside a city. In this case, the city in which this palace was located was also called Susa, because the city was associated with the palace. Since this was where the kings of Persia lived, it was the capital city of their empire. Alternate translation: “the capital city of Susa”

## Nehemiah 1:2 (#2) (id: 272444)

**"Hanani, one"**

The term **brother** is often used in this book, but here it most likely means that Hanani was Nehemiah’s biological brother.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2

## Nehemiah 1:2 (#3) (id: 272445)

**"he and men"**

This was a delegation that had come from one Jewish community to visit another Jewish community in another part of the world. So it’s possible that it included women as well as men. Alternate translation: “along with some other people”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: 33276)

## Nehemiah 1:2 (#4) (id: 272446)

**"from Judah"**

Judah was formerly the southern kingdom of the Israelites. It was now a Persian province. Alternate translation: “the province of Judah”

See: How to Translate Names

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 1:2 (#5) (id: 272447)

**"the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity"**

These two phrases mean the same thing. Nehemiah uses them together for clarity to describe one particular group of people, and perhaps also to express his particular concern for them. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had escaped the exile”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 1:2 (#6) (id: 272448)

**"the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity"**

These two phrases refer to the same group of people. This could mean: (1\) the few Jews who were taken as exiles to Babylon but who later were able to return and live in Jerusalem or (2\) the few Jews who had escaped from those who were trying to take them into exile in Babylon and so remained in Jerusalem. It is probably best to translate this in a way that can include both groups. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had escaped the exile and who remained in Jerusalem”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 1:2 (#7) (id: 272449)

**"the captivity"**

**Captivity** is an abstract noun that refers to the Jews being taken away from their homeland. Judah had been conquered by the Babylonians about 150 years before this. At that time, the Babylonians took many people away from Judah and relocated them to different parts of their empire. About 50 years later, the Persian Empire conquered Babylon and so the Babylonian empire became the Persian empire. The Jews who had been captured by Babylon now lived in Persia, although some had since returned to Judah. You can translate the idea of **captivity** with a phrase such as “the time when the Jews were taken away” or “the time when soldiers forced many Jews to go to Babylon”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 1:3 (#1) (id: 272451)

**"The ones left behind, who were left behind from the captivity"**

These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show his concern for this group. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who escaped the exile and remained”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 1:3 (#2) (id: 272452)

**"in the province"**

Here **province** refers to Judah as an administrative district within the Persian Empire. Hanani is describing Judah by referring to something associated with it, its status as a province. Alternate translation: “in the province of Judah” or “in Judah”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Nehemiah 1:3 (#3) (id: 272453)

**"are in great evil and in reproach"**

**Difficulty** and **reproach** mean similar things. Hanani uses them together to emphasize what a desperate situation the people are in. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “in a perilous situation”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: 33266)

* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Action (ID: 33402)

## Nehemiah 1:4 (#4) (id: 272462)

**"and I mourned for days"**

This means that Nehemiah kept on grieving. He did not get over being upset. The term “days” here suggests “many days” and it is a figurative expression for “a long time.” Alternate translation: “I could not stop mourning for a long time.”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 1:4 (#5) (id: 272463)

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

**"Yahweh"**

This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament.

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 1:5 (#4) (id: 272469)

**"the God of heaven"**

Since Nehemiah is addressing God directly, you can use “you” forms in your translation if that is natural. They should be singular but also respectful. Alternate translation: “you are the God who is in heaven”

See: Forms of You

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of You (ID: 33317)

## Nehemiah 1:5 (#5) (id: 272470)

**"the great and fearsome God"**

**Great** and **fearsome** mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how much respect God deserves. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also bring that out in your translation. “Great” refers to how powerful God is objectively. “Fearsome” reflects how people should respond to God’s greatness subjectively. They should “fear” God. This does not mean that they should be afraid of him, but that they should show him respect and reverence. Alternate translation: “the great and awesome God” or “the God who deserves total respect”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: 33266)

## Nehemiah 1:5 (#6) (id: 272471)

**"who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness"**

**Covenant** and **covenant faithfulness** mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how certain it is that God will keep his promises. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could bring that out in your translation even if you combine the phrases. The “covenant” is God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants. “Covenant faithfulness” is a character quality of God. He is inwardly disposed to keep all of his promises, and so he always does so faithfully. Therefore, you could say something like, “Because of who you are, you always keep your promises faithfully.”

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 1:5 (#7) (id: 272472)

**"to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments"**

Nehemiah is not describing two different groups. These phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used for clarity and emphasis. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to express that those who love God show this by keeping his commandments. You can translate this so that it is clear that these words describe one group. Alternate translation: “those who love you and keep your commandments”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 1:5 (#8) (id: 272473)

**"to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments"**

Since Nehemiah is speaking to Yahweh, the pronouns “him” and “his” can be translated as “you” and “your.” Alternate translation: “who love you and keep your commandments”

**"Please let your ear be attentive and your eyes opened"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to urge God to pay attention to him.

* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 1:6 (#2) (id: 272475)

**"your ear"** \- **"attentive"**

This request for God’s ear to be attentive refers to the action of listening. In this context, Nehemiah is asking God to listen to his prayer, with the intention that God would do something about the bad situation in Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 1:6 (#3) (id: 272476)

**"and your eyes opened"**

## Nehemiah 1:6 (#4) (id: 272477)

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 1:6 (#7) (id: 272480)

**"today, day and night"**

When Nehemiah says that he has prayed both during the day and during the night, he means that he has also prayed at all times in between, that is, constantly. However, he does not mean that he has prayed non\-stop all day long and all night long, without doing any other activities such as sleeping or eating.

## Nehemiah 1:6 (#11) (id: 272484)

**"Even I and the house of my father, we have sinned"**

Among the Israelites, the expression **father’s house** or **house of the father** originally described an extended\-family group who lived together. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. In this expression, the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. However, since Nehemiah is stressing his sense of personal responsibility here and identifying closely with the people in this group, he may be using the term in its original sense to refer to his nearest relatives. Alternate translation: “Both I and my family have also sinned”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Nehemiah 1:7 (#1) (id: 272485)

**"With extreme corruption we have acted corruptly against you"**

The repetition here is used for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. you could combine them into one phrase, with a word like **very** to convey emphasis. Alternate translation: “We have acted very corruptly toward you”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 1:7 (#2) (id: 272486)

**"With extreme corruption we have acted corruptly against you"**

You can translate the idea of the abstract noun **corruption** with a verb such as **sinned.** Alternate translation: “We have sinned very much against you”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: 33257)

## Nehemiah 1:7 (#3) (id: 272487)

**"the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments"**

These three words mean basically the same thing. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how comprehensively the Israelites have disobeyed what God commanded them through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the law of Moses” otherwise “the commands and rules and laws” (Note: A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.)

When the king gave him this assignment, this showed that he trusted Nehemiah completely to protect him from being poisoned. Nehemiah’s work also allowed him to see the king frequently and get to know him. So this was an important office.

Nehemiah 2 General Notes
========================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins the account of the construction of the wall. Many scholars believe these chapters teach valuable lessons on leadership ([Nehemiah 2–6](https://ref.ly/Neh0:0)).

### Special concepts in this chapter

### Nehemiah’s character

Apparently, Nehemiah’s character made an impression on the king. It was very unusual for a king to be so concerned with one of his servants. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### Cultural Customs

In ancient Persia, people thought it was important for their conquered peoples to retain and practice their own cultural customs. It was thought that this independence promoted peace in their vast kingdom. The rebuilding of Jerusalem may have been seen as a way to allow for the Jewish cultural practices.

### Yahweh’s control

Yahweh is seen as very powerful. He is able to provide for his people even through a foreign king. (See: People of God)

## Nehemiah 2:1 (#2) (id: 272528)

**"in the month of Nisan, in year 20 of Artaxerxes the king"**

Since there were twelve months in the Hebrew calendar, and it was still the same year in the reign of Artaxerxes, this means that four months had gone by since Hanani came and spoke with Nehemiah. The implication is that Nehemiah had been praying all this time in the way described in chapter 1\. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I prayed like this for four months”

**"and if your servant is good before your face"**

Here, **face** could be referring to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Nehemiah’s request would become evident in his face first, so that would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him.

Nehemiah’s request is not for these governors to provide him with transportation. Nehemiah explains in [2:9](https://ref.ly/Neh2:9) that the king did that for him.

**"myself and a few men with me"**

The word **men** here could conceivably include both men and women. However, for a nighttime mission through the ruins of the city walls, it’s likely that Nehemiah brought along only other men.

Nehemiah is saying that because they could not continue going along the wall, they had to take a different route. You could use an introductory word like “so” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “So we followed the path of the Kidron Brook”

## Nehemiah 2:15 (#5) (id: 272626)

**"at night"**

The implication may be “even though it was night.” The slippery, uneven ground of the path along the brook would have been more dangerous in the dark. (Nehemiah is writing a chronicle of all the things he did to help the Jews, and he records specific things that required risk or sacrifice.) Alternate translation: “even though it was night.”

## Nehemiah 2:15 (#6) (id: 272627)

**"and I was looking intently at the wall"**

The implication is that from the brook they were able to look up at the wall and see its condition. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “From there we were able to look up at the wall and see its condition.”

## Nehemiah 2:15 (#7) (id: 272628)

**"And I turned back"**

This likely means not that Nehemiah turned around, but that this route brought him and the other men back to where they started. So they were able to go all the way around the city and inspect the entire wall. Alternate translation: “This route brought us back to where we started.”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:15

**"And"** \- **"the Jews"**

While this expression means “the Jewish people” in most of the book, in the contexts here and in [5:17](https://ref.ly/Neh5:17) it seems to mean “the Jewish leaders.” Nehemiah is describing some members of this people group, its leaders, as if they were the whole group.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate his words in a way that reflects this. Alternate translation: “I challenge all of you to join me in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem.”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 2:17

## Nehemiah 2:17 (#7) (id: 272644)

**"But for you there is neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem"**

The terms **share**, **right**, and **memorial** all mean something similar. Nehemiah uses them together for emphasis. The meanings are not entirely certain. “Share” may suggest that the Samaritans are not part of the community. “Right” may mean that they have no legal basis to say what should happen in Jerusalem. “Memorial” could mean that they had have no role in the city’s history, or that there is no record of their Israelite ancestry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “But you have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in Jerusalem.” (Note: A doublet can involve the use of more than two terms.)

Nehemiah 3 General Notes
========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Priests

The priests worked on rebuilding the city. Normally, the priests were exempt from this type of work. Because they helped, it emphasizes that this is a holy work and something done for Yahweh. (See: Priest and Holy and Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### Cooperation

Everyone worked on this project. Many names are mentioned to emphasize the cooperation between the different families. Each was given a section of the wall to rebuild.

## Nehemiah 3:1 (#1) (id: 272666)

**"And Eliashib the high priest rose up"**

This chapter records the names of the people who repaired the wall of Jerusalem, and it describes what parts of the wall they worked on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly at the start of the chapter. (In this book Nehemiah records everything he did to help the people of Judah, and he prays that God will remember him and bless him for what he did. We see in this chapter that he also wants God to remember and bless everyone else who helped.) Alternate translation: “These are the names of the people who helped to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem. Now Eliashib the high priest rose up”

**"and they built"**

It is clear from the context that they were not building something brand new. Rather, they were rebuilding the walls that had been knocked down. This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “rebuilt.”

## Nehemiah 3:1 (#8) (id: 272673)

**"They themselves consecrated it"**

**Consecrate** means to set something apart for a special purpose. The Sheep Gate was the gate closest to the temple. By dedicating it to God, the priests were symbolically dedicating the entire wall to God. The rebuilt wall would define and protect the city of Jerusalem as the place from which God had chosen to start making himself famous throughout the world, as described in [1:9](https://ref.ly/Neh1:9).

## Nehemiah 3:1 (#11) (id: 272676)

**"And they consecrated it as far as the tower of the hundred and as far as the tower of Hananel"**

In this record of people who helped rebuild the wall, Nehemiah is writing more of a list than a narrative, so he often leaves out one or more words that a sentence normally would have in order to be complete. This sentence seems to mean, “They rebuilt the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, and beyond that to the Tower of Hananel. Then they dedicated that part of the wall to God as well.” You could say something like that if it would be helpful to your readers.

**"the tower of the hundred"**

It is not clear why this tower had this name. The tower could have been 100 cubits high (about 150 feet or about 45 meters), or 100 soldiers may have been stationed there. Since the reason is unknown, it might be best just to call this the “Tower of the Hundred.” However, if it would be confusing to your readers not to explain the meaning of the number, you suggest one of these possibilities. Alternate translation: “The Tower of the Hundred Soldiers” or “The Hundred\-Cubit Tower.”

The word **men** here can include women, and it does seem to include them in this context. Elsewhere in this chapter, [3:12](https://ref.ly/Neh3:12) tells us that “Shallum and his daughters repaired part of the wall.” So we know that both men and women worked on this project.

## Nehemiah - Chapter 4 Introduction (id: 718676)

Nehemiah 4 General Notes
========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Dedication

The people were so dedicated to rebuilding the walls that they worked with their weapons ready for battle right next to them. Even when they were threatened with an attack, they continued to trust in Yahweh. (See: Trust)

Important figures of speech in this chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Rhetorical Questions

Sanballat uses a series of rhetorical questions. These are intended to show his intense anger against the Israelites. (See: Rhetorical Question)

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:1
* **Associated Articles:** Trust (ID: 27180); Rhetorical Question (ID: 33310)

## Nehemiah 4:1 (#1) (id: 272807)

**"And it happened"**

Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses.

See: Introduction of a New Event

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:1
* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Nehemiah 4:1 (#2) (id: 272808)

**"Sanballat"**

This is a man’s name. See how you translated this in [2:10](https://ref.ly/Neh2:10).

See: How to Translate Names

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:1
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 4:1 (#3) (id: 272809)

**"that,"** \- **"it burned him, and he was very angry"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how angry Sanballat was. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like “he became furiously angry” or “he became very angry”

See: Parallelism

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:1
* **Associated Articles:** Parallelism (ID: 33299)

## Nehemiah 4:1 (#4) (id: 272810)

**"that,"** \- **"it burned him, and he was"** \- **"angry"**

Here Nehemiah says that Sanballat’s anger was a fire that burned inside of him. Alternate translation: “he became furious”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#1) (id: 272811)

**"And he spoke before the face of"**

Here, **face** represents the presence of a person. The expression means that Sanballat was speaking personally to the other people who are named. Alternate translation: “He said to”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#2) (id: 272812)

**"his brothers"**

Here, **brother** likely refers to Sanballat’s fellow officials. Alternate translation: “the other provincial officials”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#3) (id: 272813)

**"and the army of Samaria"**

Sanballat was not speaking to the entire army. Nehemiah is using all of something to mean part of it. He is referring to the officers of the army by the name of the entire army. Alternate translation: “the army officers”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: 33315)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#4) (id: 272814)

**"What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they restore for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day"**

Sanballat actually is making a series of statements, not asking a series of questions. He does not expect the officials and officers to tell him what the Jews are doing and whether they will succeed. Instead, he is using the question form to mock the Jews. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the ideas in his questions as a series of statements. Alternate translation: “These feeble Jews can accomplish nothing. They will never restore the city for themselves. They will not offer sacrifices. They will not finish the work any time soon.”

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: 33310)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#5) (id: 272815)

**"Will they sacrifice"**

The meaning of this phrase is not entirely clear. It could be that Sanballat is speaking of the Jews offering sacrifices to try to entice God to make their project successful. Alternate translation: “They will not get their God to help them”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#6) (id: 272816)

**"Will they finish in a day"**

In this context, the expression “day” means “a short time.” Alternate translation: “any time soon”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#7) (id: 272817)

**"Will they bring to life the stones from piles of dust, when they have been burned"**

Here Sanballat is speaking of stones as if they could come to life and stand up straight to form the wall. Alternate translation: “They will not be able to rebuild the city walls from useless stones that were burned and turned into rubble”

See: Personification

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:2
* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: 33302)

## Nehemiah 4:2 (#8) (id: 272818)

**"from piles of dust, when they have been burned"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “useless stones that someone has burned and turned into rubble”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 4:3 (#1) (id: 272819)

**"And Tobiah the Ammonite"**

This is a man’s name. See how you translated this in [2:10](https://ref.ly/Neh2:10).

See: How to Translate Names

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:3
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 4:3 (#2) (id: 272820)

**"Yes"**

This word indicates that Tobiah agrees with Sanballat and that he is going to say something to support him. Alternate translation: “That’s right!”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:3

## Nehemiah 4:3 (#3) (id: 272821)

**"if a fox goes up on what they are building, then he would break down their wall of stones"**

Tobiah probably does not believe that the wall would really fall down if a fox walked along the top of it. He is exaggerating to mock the work the Jews are doing. You could use a plain expression in your translation instead, such as, “It wouldn’t take much to make that wall fall over.” However, Tobiah’s expression is so colorful that you may want to retain it, but be sure that your readers understand he is exaggerating. Alternate translation: “Tobiah made fun of the Jews by saying, ‘That wall they are building is so weak that if a fox climbed up on it, the stones would fall to the ground’”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:3
* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: 33281)

## Nehemiah 4:4 (#1) (id: 272822)

**"Hear, our God"**

Nehemiah starts talking directly to God at this point in the book. The implication is that he heard about what Sanballat and Tobiah were saying, and in response, he prayed the prayer that is recorded here in 2:4–5\. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When I heard about what they were saying, I prayed and said, ‘Listen, our God’”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 4:4 (#2) (id: 272823)

**"Hear, our God"**

Nehemiah’s prayer here is a particular type of aside. In an aside, someone who is speaking to or about one person or group will pause and speak confidentially to somebody else about them. Often an aside is spoken to the audience of a work about someone who is being addressed within the work. But in this case, Nehemiah pauses from addressing the audience that is hearing his story; he speaks confidentially to God in prayer about two of the characters in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this is a prayer is distinct from the story by making it a direct quotation.

This expression could mean one of the following three things: (1\) It could mean that they have made God angry by opposing the work he has commanded Nehemiah to do. Alternate translation: “they have made you become angry.” This possibility seems the most likely, since Nehemiah is praying that what these men are trying to do to others will happen to them. (2\) It could mean that they have caused others to be angry at the people who are rebuilding the wall. Alternate translation: “they have caused others to be angry at the people who are rebuilding the wall.” (3\) It could mean that Sanballat and Tobiah have made the builders angry by mocking them.

Nehemiah is describing how he maintained a constant guard by speaking of two times when people were on duty, the day and the night, in order to include all the time in between.

**"the Jews dwelling beside them"**

**Them** means the enemies Nehemiah has been talking about, so this expression likely refers to the Jews who lived near Nehemiah and those helping him.

## Nehemiah 4:12 (#4) (id: 272858)

**"From all the places where you turn, they are on us"**

The meaning of this Hebrew phrase is uncertain. However, one explanation that would fit the context is that these exposed Jewish communities sent representatives to Jerusalem to tell Nehemiah that they were afraid of being attacked in their villages. The “places where you return” could mean “anywhere we live,” referring to the villages, and “they are on us” could mean that the enemies could attack these undefended towns at any time. Perhaps these representatives were asking Nehemiah to release their able\-bodied men from work duty and send them home so they could help defend their families and neighbors. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Our enemies could attack us anywhere we live, so let our men return home so they can defend us!”

## Nehemiah 4:13 (#1) (id: 272860)

**"And I stationed"**

If you follow the suggestion in the previous note for translating the last phrase in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Neh4:12), then you could show here that Nehemiah is indicating a contrast between what the representatives wanted him to do and what he actually did. Instead of scattering his forces by sending the men from other towns home, he concentrated them visibly in Jerusalem, expecting that the main attack would come there. Alternate translation: “But” or “Instead”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:13

## Nehemiah 4:13 (#2) (id: 272861)

**"And I stationed from the lowest of places behind the wall, in the bare places"**

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:13

## Nehemiah 4:13 (#3) (id: 272862)

**"and I stationed the people by families"**

This does not mean all the people, and it does not mean every member of every family. Nehemiah is describing part of the people as if they were all of them, and part of each family as if it were the whole family. Chapter 3 describes how Nehemiah organized the work on the wall by family and community groups. He seems to have organized the defense of the city the same way. Alternate translation: “I positioned people from each family”

## Nehemiah 4:14 (#2) (id: 272865)

**"and I rose up, and I said"**

**"the rest of the people"**

Here, the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. All of the descendants of Judah are being described as if they were one household living together. So this would ordinarily mean “the people of Judah”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 4:16 (#10) (id: 272890)

**"all the house of Judah"**

However, in this context, the expression is not referring to all the people of Judah. Nehemiah is describing part of the people as if they were all of them. He means all of the workers and guards. The expression helps clarify that Nehemiah is no longer speaking just of his own servants, whom had divided into two groups to serve as workers and guards. Alternate translation: “all the workers and guards”

## Nehemiah 4:17 (#1) (id: 272891)

**"and those who were carrying burdens, the loaders"**

These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together for clarity and emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “and those who carried the heavy loads”

## Nehemiah 4:17 (#2) (id: 272892)

**"the loaders, they were doing the work with one of his hands and one grasping weaponry"**

Here **his hands** means “their hands.” This is an exaggeration. The builders and porters did not always work with only one hand. Rather, this means that they always had their weapons with them so that they would be prepared to fight off an attack. Alternate translation: “they always had their weapons with them while they were working on the wall”

## Nehemiah 4:18 (#1) (id: 272893)

## Nehemiah 4:18 (#2) (id: 272894)

**"And the one who blew the ram’s horn was beside me"**

The implication is that Nehemiah stationed this person next to him so that he could sound a signal if needed. (This becomes clear in [4:20](https://ref.ly/Neh4:20).) If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “And I stationed someone next to me who would blow a ram’s horn if we needed a signal”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:19

## Nehemiah 4:19 (#2) (id: 272896)

**"the nobles"** \- **"the prefects"**

As in [4:14](https://ref.ly/Neh4:14), this does not mean all of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, but rather many of them who came to hear Nehemiah speak on this occasion. He is describing part of the people as if they were all of them. Alternate translation: “many of the other people”

## Nehemiah 4:19 (#3) (id: 272897)

**"The work is great and vast"**

**Great** and **vast** mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize the scope of the rebuilding project. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “large\-scale” or “huge”

## Nehemiah 4:19 (#4) (id: 272898)

**"and we are separated on the wall, a man far from his brother"**

In this context, **a man** means “each person,” and **brother** means “fellow Jew.” Alternate translation: “each of us is far apart from our fellow Jews along the wall”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:19
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 4:20 (#1) (id: 272899)

**"the sound of the ram’s horn"**

The implication is that the workers and guards would need to gather together to fight off an attack. The implication is also that while the people were widely scattered, they would all be able to hear the ram’s horn even from a distance, and so it would be an effective signal. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “So if we all need to gather in one place to fight off an attack, I will have someone blow a ram’s horn there. You will be able to hear this signal from anywhere along the wall.”

## Nehemiah 4:21 (#1) (id: 272902)

## Nehemiah 4:21 (#2) (id: 272903)

**"And half of them were grasping spears"**

“Them” means the men who would otherwise have been working as builders or carrying loads, but who were serving as guards instead. As verses [4:13](https://ref.ly/Neh4:13) and [4:16](https://ref.ly/Neh4:16) make clear, the weaponry included not just spears, but also shields and bows and arrows. So Nehemiah is using “spears” here to refer to all of the weaponry. Alternate translation: “half of the men served as guards and kept their weapons ready”

## Nehemiah 4:21 (#4) (id: 272905)

**"from the rising of the dawn until the coming out of the stars"**

Nehemiah is referring to the entire day by speaking of two extreme parts of it, the time when first light of morning appears and the time when it becomes dark enough to see the stars, in order to include everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “at all times,” otherwise “from the time when the light of dawn appeared in the morning until the time when the stars appeared at night”

## Nehemiah 4:22 (#1) (id: 272908)

**"a man"**

In this context, **a man** means “each person” and more specifically “each worker.” As in 4:16, “young man” means servant. Alternate translation: “each worker and his servant”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 4:22 (#2) (id: 272909)

**"in the midst of Jerusalem"**

This could be referring to workers who had come from nearby cities and towns to help rebuild the wall. It could also include people who lived in the Jerusalem area but whose homes were outside the city, such as local farmers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “spend the night inside Jerusalem and not go home if they live outside the city”

## Nehemiah 4:22 (#3) (id: 272910)

**"and they will be for us by night a guard and by day a worker"**

The idea is not that these men would be on guard duty all night and then work all day on the wall. Rather, their presence in the city would mean that a large number of defenders would be ready on short notice if needed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “That way the city will have plenty of defenders even at night, and they can still work on the wall during the daytime”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 4:22

## Nehemiah 4:23 (#1) (id: 272911)

**"And neither"**

In this verse Nehemiah is describing something else that was also true of the conditions in Jerusalem during the time period he is describing. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “At that time, neither”

## Nehemiah 4:23 (#2) (id: 272912)

**"nor my brothers"**

Here **brother** likely refers to Nehemiah’s close relatives. Elsewhere in the book he indicates that his brother Hanani lived in the city and that his relatives ate with him at the governor’s table ([1:2](https://ref.ly/Neh1:2), [5:14](https://ref.ly/Neh5:14), [7:2](https://ref.ly/Neh7:2)).

## Nehemiah 4:23 (#5) (id: 272915)

**"or a man his weapon at the water"**

Here the specific meaning of the Hebrew text is unknown, but Nehemiah is almost certainly leaving out some of the words that a sentence would normally have to have in order to be complete. He says that he and his relatives, servants, and bodyguards did not take off their clothes, **or anyone his weapon at the water.** This could mean that “no one took his weapon off even when he was washing himself” or that “no one took his weapon off even when going to get water.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain what “at the water” might mean, you could choose one of these possibilities. Alternate translation: “Each of us always had our weapons with us, even when we were washing ourselves.”

## Nehemiah - Chapter 5 Introduction (id: 718677)

Nehemiah 5 General Notes
========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Equality

The rich made money from the poor. The rich oppressed the poor by charging interest on loans. Because Nehemiah wanted to treat everyone fairly, he did not collect any taxes from them. This chapter also emphasizes that it was wrong to enslave a fellow Jew. (See: oppress)

### Governor

Nehemiah was a governmental leader in Jerusalem, but he was not a king. Jerusalem had a great deal of independence, but it was under the authority of the Persian king. The term “governor” reflects this idea, but a different term may be used in translation.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:1

## Nehemiah 5:1 (#1) (id: 272917)

**"And there was"**

Nehemiah now relates something else that was happening even while the Jews were trying to rebuild the wall and defend themselves against their enemies. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “Around this same time”

* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Simultaneous Time Relationship (ID: 33334)

## Nehemiah 5:1 (#2) (id: 272918)

**"a great outcry of the people and their wives"**

**Outcry** is an abstract noun that refers to the complaints that the poorer Jews made to Nehemiah about how the wealthier and more powerful Jews were treating them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “complain.” Since Nehemiah says this was a “great” outcry, involving many serious grievances, you could intensify the verb with an adverb such as “bitterly.” Alternate translation: “many of the men and their wives complained bitterly”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: 33257)

## Nehemiah 5:1 (#3) (id: 272919)

**"the people and their wives"**

Here, **the people** seems to indicate certain men who lived in Jerusalem, since Nehemiah also mentions their wives. Alternate translation: “many of the men and their wives”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:1

## Nehemiah 5:1 (#4) (id: 272920)

**"their brothers"**

Here, **brother** does not seem to mean biological brothers, but to refer to other members of the same people group. Alternate translation: “their fellow Jews”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 5:1 (#5) (id: 272921)

**"their brothers, the Jews"**

These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how inappropriate it was for people to treat members of their own group in the ways described. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “their fellow Jews”

## Nehemiah 5:2 (#1) (id: 272922)

**"And there were those who said"**

Verses 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not seem to be different complaints that people brought to Nehemiah separately. Rather, the whole group seems to be complaining that because they need to get food for their families, wealthier and more powerful Jews are exploiting them. They are forcing them to take mortgages and loans and even sell their children into slavery. Nehemiah is probably depicting one speaker after another in the crowd adding details to this picture. You could suggest this to the readers of your translation by introducing these comments with a translation such as, “some of them began to say”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:2

## Nehemiah 5:2 (#2) (id: 272923)

**"Our sons and our daughters, we are many"**

Alternate translation: “We have many children”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:2

## Nehemiah 5:2 (#3) (id: 272924)

**"And let us take grain"**

This does not mean only grain. The people complaining to Nehemiah are using one kind of food, grain, the staple of their diet, to refer to all the foods they would need to eat. Alternate translation: “we need food”

It might be helpful to explain to your readers what a **mortgage** is, if you think they might not know.

These two phrases mean similar things. The people complaining to Nehemiah are using the repetition to emphasize how shameful it is for the wealthy and powerful to sell their own fellow Jews into slavery.

**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use some emphatic term or expression in your language that would have this same effect.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:5

## Nehemiah 5:5 (#7) (id: 272938)

**"we are putting our sons and our daughters into bondage as slaves. There are those even of our daughters who have been put into bondage"**

In this context, the construction **are putting** likely indicates that the poor are on the verge of selling their children into slavery. The next sentence shows that they have already done this in some instances. It appears that in this culture, in dire situations, girls were sold before boys, perhaps because they could become either domestic servants or concubines. A concubine was a woman who was both a slave and a secondary wife to her master. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this statement that way. Alternate translation: “We are on the verge of selling our children into slavery. In fact, we have already sold some of our daughters as servants and concubines.”

**"And my heart reigned over me"**

Here Nehemiah is speaking about his heart as if it were a living thing that could act like a king and rule over him. However, he is not saying that his feelings commanded his actions. (He says in the previous verse that he became very angry, but in the next verse he describes acting in a careful and deliberate manner.) Instead, this means that his heart “took counsel” with him, the way a king would take counsel with advisors. In effect, Nehemiah is saying that he talked the matter over with himself.

## Nehemiah 5:7 (#6) (id: 272950)

**"interest, a man against his brother"**

The Law of Moses specifically forbade charging interest on a loan to a fellow Jew. So this was not just an exploitive business practice, it was a violation of God’s Law. The rich and powerful Jews would certainly have been expected to know this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are charging interest on loans to your fellow Jews. You know that is forbidden in the Law of Moses.”

## Nehemiah 5:10 (#4) (id: 272979)

**"Please, let us forsake this interest"**

It is clear from the context that **us** in this sentence does not mean Nehemiah and his companions, but rather the entire Jewish community, of which they are a part. Nehemiah could say to the defendants, accusingly, “You must stop charging interest!” But he includes himself and the entire community as a way of being encouraging rather than condemning. (This would be a use of “we/us” that includes the addressees. You should make this clear in your translation if your language makes that distinction.)

## Nehemiah 5:11 (#3) (id: 272982)

**"and a hundred of"**

In this context, this expression means “the hundredth part,” or one per cent. In this culture, this was likely charged monthly, so it would have amounted to 12% annual interest. In an economy that was based more on commodities than on cash, this would have been an exorbitant amount. If your culture typically calculates interest at an annual rate, you could express it that way here to help your readers understand the likely meaning.

Nehemiah gathered his robe together in front of him, the way someone would if they wanted to carry something in its folds.

**"and they took from them bread and wine, after forty silver shekels"**

**After** indicates that the supplies of bread and wine were in addition to the money. Nehemiah is likely describing what the former governors required of the people each day.

## Nehemiah 5:15 (#5) (id: 273017)

**"forty silver shekels"**

In ancient times, a silver shekel weighed about 11 grams or about a third of an ounce. You could try to express this in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate over time, since those values can change from year to year. Instead, you could say something general like “40 silver coins,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note.

## Nehemiah 5:15 (#9) (id: 273021)

**"from the face of the fear of God"**

Here, **face** represents Nehemiah’s personal perception. “Fearing” God does not mean being afraid of God, but recognizing that God deserves respect and honor. Nehemiah is speaking of this perception figuratively, as if this recognition was always directly in front of him in a place where he could see it. He means that he was always aware of it.

**"I held fast to the work of this wall"**

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:16

## Nehemiah 5:16 (#3) (id: 273024)

**"and we did not buy a field"**

Nehemiah is using the term **field** to describe any kind of real property that he and his relatives might have bought. Verse 11 shows that this could have included not just fields but also things like vineyards, olive orchards, and houses. He is describing all real property by reference to one kind, a field.

**"Now the Jews"**

While this expression means “the Jewish people” in most of the book, in the context here and in 2:16 it seems to mean “Jewish leaders.” Nehemiah is describing some members of this people group, its leaders, as if they were the whole group. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders”

**"And what was made for one day was one bull, six choice sheep, and birds were made for me"**

Nehemiah seems once again to be leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He probably means something like, “What was prepared for one day is as follows: One bull, six choice sheep, and birds; that is what was prepared for me.” You could simplify the sentence for your readers by not including “were prepared for me” again at the end. Alternate translation: “Each day I told my servants to prepare one ox, six good sheep, and various kinds of poultry”

**"So with this I did not seek the bread of the governor"**

As in [5:14](https://ref.ly/Neh5:14), “the bread of the governor” means “the governor’s food allowance.” The implication is that, at his own expense, Nehemiah paid for all of the things he has just described. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I paid for all of these things at my own expense. I did not accept the governor’s food allowance”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 5:18

## Nehemiah 5:18 (#8) (id: 273038)

Nehemiah 6 General Notes
========================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

The building of the wall is completed in this chapter.

The ULT sets the lines in 6:6–7 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are part of a long quotation.

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Miracle

Completing this city wall in only 52 days was considered proof that God had helped the Jews, especially given the opposition that they had experienced from the people in surrounding areas.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:1

## Nehemiah 6:1 (#1) (id: 273045)

**"And it happened"**

Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses.

## Nehemiah 6:1 (#2) (id: 273046)

**"it was heard"**

## Nehemiah 6:2 (#2) (id: 273054)

**"Come, and let us appoint a time to meet together"**

These enemies use the word **come** to encourage Nehemiah to accept their invitation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the word as something other than an imperative to make the message sound inviting. Alternate translation: “We would like to arrange to meet with you”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:2

## Nehemiah 6:2 (#3) (id: 273055)

**"among the villages in the valley of Ono"**

Ono is the name of a place about twenty miles from Jerusalem. It is down from the mountains towards the Mediterranean coast, so it can be described as a “valley” or “plain.” Alternate translation: “in one of the villages in the plain of Ono”

## Nehemiah 6:3 (#2) (id: 273059)

**"and I am not able to go down"**

Nehemiah does not mean that he is physically unable to travel to Ono. He means that he cannot leave his supervision of the work for the several days it would take to travel there and back. Alternate translation: “I am not able to travel while it is going on”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:3

## Nehemiah 6:3 (#3) (id: 273060)

**"to go down"**

Nehemiah uses the word **down** because the plain of Ono is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “meet with you”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:3

## Nehemiah 6:3 (#4) (id: 273061)

**"Why should the work stop while I abandon it and go down to you"**

Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect Sanballat and Geshem to give him reasons why the work should stop as he travels to meet with them. Instead, Nehemiah is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for the work of rebuilding the walls to continue. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his question as a statement. Alternate translation: “I cannot let the work stop and come down to you”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:3
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: 33310)

## Nehemiah 6:3 (#5) (id: 273062)

The word **down** is used here because the plain of Ono where they were requesting Nehemiah to come is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem.

This means that this fifth message was written in a letter, but the letter was unsealed. Alternate translation: “This time the message was written, but it was not sealed”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:5

## Nehemiah 6:5 (#3) (id: 273068)

**"and an opened letter was in his hand"**

As a diplomatic communication, the letter should have been sealed. Because it was not, others could read it and spread its contents among the people of the region. It appears that Sanballat deliberately left the letter unsealed to pressure Nehemiah to meet with him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly.

## Nehemiah 6:10 (#5) (id: 273100)

**"and he was confined"**

Nehemiah does not say why Shemaiah was not leaving his house. He could have been sick or he could have been ceremonially unclean, so you might choose not to specify any reason. However, the context suggests that Shemaiah may have been trying to symbolize that it was not safe for Jewish leaders to go around in public. A man by the name of Shemaiah is listed in [10:8](https://ref.ly/Neh10:8) as one of the priests who signed the community agreement. This could be the same person since he has access to the temple and is therefore likely a priest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could suggest this reason explicitly. Alternate translation: “He was a priest, and he was trying to show that it was not safe for Jewish leaders to go out in public, so he was not leaving his house”

**"in the house of God, in the midst of the temple"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Shemaiah uses the repetition to emphasize the danger he is suggesting they are in. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “into the temple”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:10

## Nehemiah 6:10 (#10) (id: 273105)

**"for they are coming to kill you"**

Shemaiah does not say who these people are. It would be possible to say something based on what can reasonably be inferred. For example, “Your enemies have hired people to kill you.” However, the vagueness seems to be part of Shemaiah’s strategy to frighten Nehemiah. So it might be more effective to leave this indefinite. Alternate translation: “because people are trying to kill you”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:10

## Nehemiah 6:10 (#11) (id: 273106)

**"Yes, at night they are coming to kill you"**

Shemaiah’s confidence in the detail of “at night” seems designed to make Nehemiah even more afraid because this means that the killers will come in the dark when he is asleep, so he won’t be able to protect himself. It could be helpful to your readers for your translation to reflect this confidence. Alternate translation: “I know that one night they are going to come and kill you”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:10

## Nehemiah 6:11 (#2) (id: 273108)

**"Should a man such as I run away"**

Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect Shemiah to tell him whether or not he should run away. Instead, Nehemiah is using the question form to emphasize that he is not going to do what Shemaiah has suggested. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this question as a statement. Alternate translation: “A man like me would not run away.”

**"And who, such as I, is it that could go in to the temple and live"**

Once again Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect Shemiah to tell him whether going into the temple would save his life. Alternate translation: “A man like me would not go into the temple just to hide to stay alive.”

See: Rhetorical Question

## Nehemiah 6:11 (#4) (id: 273110)

**"And who, such as I, is it that could go in to the temple and live"**

It is not entirely clear what Nehemiah means by this. He could be saying that he should not go into the temple because he is not a priest. However, the Bible records instances of other people who were not priests going into the temple to seek sanctuary. So Nehemiah may be saying instead that because he is the governor he is too well known to escape from assassins by hiding in the temple. You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Besides, I am the governor, and everyone knows me, so I could not save my life by trying to hide in the temple”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 6:12

## Nehemiah 6:12 (#2) (id: 273113)

**"God had not sent him"**

Shemaiah seems to have been pretending that God had revealed to him prophetically that people would be coming secretly at night to kill Nehemiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God had not given Shemaiah a prophetic message for me”

## Nehemiah 6:13 (#1) (id: 273115)

**"For this purpose he was hired, so that I would be afraid"**

This is the reason why Nehemiah’s enemies had hired Shemaiah; because they wanted to cause Nehemiah to be afraid. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The reason they had hired him was to scare me. They hoped that as a result”

## Nehemiah 6:13 (#4) (id: 273118)

**"and I would do thus and sin"**

It is not entirely clear why Nehemiah says it would have been a sin for him to hide in the temple since it was a time\-honored tradition in Israel to allow people to seek sanctuary there. Perhaps the explanation is that Nehemiah knew God had sent him to Judah on a special mission to help and protect the Jewish community there. And so, if he had abandoned that mission to save his life, he would have been disobeying God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They were hoping they could make me sin by abandoning my responsibilities and hiding in the temple.”

**"And it might become an evil name to them, so that they could reproach me"**

Here, **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. If he hid in the temple to save his own life, Nehemiah would get a bad reputation as a coward who was concerned only for himself. Alternate translation: “this would give me a bad reputation, and they could say bad things about me to everyone”

## Nehemiah - Chapter 7 Introduction (id: 718679)

Nehemiah 7 General Notes
========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Genealogy

The people who returned from Persia were counted according to their families. Nehemiah ensured that those who lived in Jerusalem had a completely Jewish ancestry.

### Different lists

This list is paralleled in [Ezra 2](https://ref.ly/Ezra0:0). The lists do contain some differences in numbers. This is probably due to the timing of their counting. They were likely counted at different times.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:1

## Nehemiah 7:1 (#1) (id: 273156)

**"And it happened"**

This expression introduces a new event in the story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses.

See: Introduction of a New Event

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Nehemiah 7:1 (#2) (id: 273157)

**"when the wall was built"**

You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “when we had finished the wall”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 7:1 (#3) (id: 273158)

**"and I had set up the doors"**

As in [4:14](https://ref.ly/Neh4:14) and [6:1](https://ref.ly/Neh6:1), Nehemiah is using himself to represent the entire community that he is a part of. Alternate translation: “and we had put the doors in the gates”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: 33315)

## Nehemiah 7:1 (#4) (id: 273159)

**"that,"** \- **"the gatekeepers and the ones who sang and the Levites were appointed"**

You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Nehemiah may have done this personally, or the people in charge of each of these groups may have done it. Because of the uncertainly, a good approach might be to say “we” to indicate the community. Alternate translation: “we assigned the gatekeepers and singers and Levites to their tasks”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 7:1 (#5) (id: 273160)

**"the gatekeepers"**

These were people who were assigned to each gate of Jerusalem. They were responsible for controlling access to the city. They would open and close the gates at times and for reasons set by the city administrators. For example, Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah is named in 3:29 as the keeper of the East Gate.

## Nehemiah 7:2 (#2) (id: 273163)

**"Hanani, my brother"**

As in [1:2](https://ref.ly/Neh1:2), **brother** here most likely indicates that Hanani was Nehemiah’s biological brother. Alternate translation: “my brother Hanani”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:2

## Nehemiah 7:2 (#3) (id: 273164)

Alternate translation: “who was in charge of the fortress”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:2

## Nehemiah 7:2 (#6) (id: 273167)

**"For he was according to a faithful man"**

**He** means Hananiah. “He was as a faithful man” is a way of saying “he was such as only a faithful man would be.” Alternate translation: “I appointed Hananiah because he was trustworthy”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:2

## Nehemiah 7:2 (#7) (id: 273168)

**"and he feared God more than many"**

Here, **fear** does not mean to be afraid of God, but to show God reverence and respect. Alternate translation: “because he showed God more reverence and respect than most people do”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 7:3 (#2) (id: 273170)

Hanani and Hananiah would not have opened the gates physically themselves. Rather, they would have ordered this to be done. Alternate translation: “Do not order the gates of Jerusalem to be opened”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 7:3 (#3) (id: 273171)

**"until the sun becomes hot"**

Here Nehemiah probably uses the heat of the sun to represent the light of the sun. His intent is to open the gates some time after the sun rises regardless of how hot the sun shines on any particular day. Alternate translation: “until broad daylight”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Nehemiah 7:3 (#4) (id: 273172)

**"until the sun becomes hot"**

The implication is that the gatekeepers should not open the gates at sunrise, as would have been customary, because the enemies of the Jews could launch a surprise attack in the dim light before most of the city was up and ready for the day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “until broad daylight. That way we will be able to see anything our enemies are doing”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 7:3 (#5) (id: 273173)

## Nehemiah 7:3 (#6) (id: 273174)

**"And set up watches for those who dwell in Jerusalem, a man in his watch, and a man in front of his house"**

In this context, **a man** means **each man.** It is likely that adult males were intended for this dangerous night duty. “A man in his watch” means that each man should take a turn, and “a man in front of his house” means that each man should keep watch in his own neighborhood. Alternate translation: “Have the men who live in Jerusalem take turns keeping watch in their own neighborhoods”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 7:4 (#1) (id: 273175)

**"Now the city was wide on two hands and great"**

These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how large Jerusalem was. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “The city of Jerusalem covered a large area”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 7:4
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: 33266)

## Nehemiah 7:4 (#2) (id: 273176)

**"And my God gave to my heart"**

The implication is that registering the people was a first step toward filling Jerusalem with people again, a process that Nehemiah will describe in chapter 11\. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a first step towards filling Jerusalem with people again, God led me”

## Nehemiah 7:61 (#6) (id: 273298)

**"the house of their fathers and their seed"**

Among the Israelites, the expression **father’s house** or **house of the father** originally described an extended clan. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. (For example, the two expressions are used interchangeably in Exodus 6:14, “These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanok, Pallu, Hezron, and Karmi. These were the clan ancestors of Reuben.”) In this expression, the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “what clan they were from”

This was a pair of objects that the high priest kept in the breastpiece of his robe. It is unknown exactly what type of objects they were, but they were used to answer yes\-or\-no questions and to decide between two alternatives. If the priest, without looking, pulled out the Urim, that meant one answer, while if he pulled out the Thummim, that meant the other answer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could describe these objects by their function rather than by their names.

In ancient times, a gold daric weighed about 8 or 8\.5 grams or about a quarter of an ounce. You could try to express this in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate over time, since those values can change from year to year. Instead, you could say something general like “1,000 gold coins,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note.

**"the priests, and the Levites, and the gatekeepers, and the ones who sang, and some from the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel"**

Five of the groups in this list are also named in the document about the people who returned from exile: the priests (verses 39–43\), the Levites (verse 43\), the gatekeepers (verse 45\), the singers (verse 44\), and the temple servants (verses 46–56\). You can use those same names for these groups here. It is not immediately clear who “some from the people” are, and why they are not included in “all Israel.” You could just say “many ordinary people.” However, there is very similar list in [10:28](https://ref.ly/Neh10:28) that names these same five groups and also describes people who dedicated themselves to following the law of God. That would unfortunately not have included all of Israel at this point, so that may be the distinction that is in view here.

The rebuilding of the wall was completed that year near the end of Elul, the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar. The implication is that everyone who had come to Jerusalem to work on the wall was then allowed to return home. Within about a week, by the beginning of the seventh month, they were all back home. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “So … returned to their homes, because the rebuilding of the wall had been completed.

Nehemiah 8 General Notes
========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Reading of the law

During the exile, the Hebrew language was no longer spoken. Only the priests and Levites still understood it. Ezra read the book of the law to the people in Hebrew and the Levites walked among the crowd translating it into Aramaic for the people to understand. (See: Priest and Law of Moses)

### Festival of Shelters

After they heard Ezra read the law of Moses, the people obeyed it by making temporary shelters for themselves with tree branches. They did this to remember that their ancestors slept in shelters when they came out of slavery in Egypt.

* **Associated Articles:** Law of Moses (ID: 26817); Priest (ID: 26979)

## Nehemiah 8:1 (#1) (id: 273338)

**"all the people"**

The word **all** is a generalization that indicates that everyone who was able and available came to Jerusalem for this occasion. By “the people,” Nehemiah means the groups he described in the previous verse who had come back to live in Judah and Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “The people of Judah”

## Nehemiah 8:1 (#2) (id: 273339)

**"And"** \- **"gathered as one man"**

Verses 8 and 9 explain that the people had gathered for a festival, and [8:2](https://ref.ly/Neh8:2) states that this was the first day of the seventh month, which means that the people had gathered in Jerusalem for the Festival of Trumpets. In the Law of Moses, Yahweh had commanded the people to observe this celebration on this date. If it would be helpful to your readers to know why the people came together on this day, you could say that specifically. Alternate translation: “gathered in Jerusalem in a huge crowd for a special celebration known as the Festival of Trumpets.”

## Nehemiah 8:1 (#7) (id: 273344)

**"And they said to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses"**

**They** means the crowd, though they likely made this request to Ezra through their leaders. The implication is that they wanted him not just to bring the book forward, but to read to them from it out loud (as [8:3](https://ref.ly/Neh8:3) indicates he did). This was because they wanted to learn what was in it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The crowd had asked Ezra the scribe to read to them from a scroll that contained the Law of Moses because they wanted to know what it commanded.”

## Nehemiah 8:1 (#8) (id: 273345)

**"And they said to Ezra"**

Since the rest of the chapter describes arrangements that the leaders must have made in advance, the crowd, once it gathered, did not start shouting spontaneously for Ezra to come forward and read. Rather, they had made this request in advance. Alternate translation: “And the crowd had asked Ezra”

## Nehemiah 8:1 (#9) (id: 273346)

**"to Ezra the scribe"**

This introduces Ezra as a new character in the story. The expression “the scribe” identifies him as a teacher who had carefully studied the Law of Moses. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could call him something like “a man named Ezra, who was a teacher of the Law of Moses”

## Nehemiah 8:1 (#10) (id: 273347)

**"to Ezra the scribe"**

The biblical book of Ezra indicates that this man returned to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon 13 years before Nehemiah did. He led many reforms in the community. But in this book, Nehemiah does not say whether Ezra had remained in the city all that time, or whether he had gone back to Babylon and had recently returned to Jerusalem again. Even if your language, in telling a story, ordinarily accounts for how a person came to be on the scene, it might be best not to try to address that question here in your translation. Even though Nehemiah seems to expect that his readers will know where Ezra had been, Nehemiah does not say specifically where he was, and so the answer is unknown.

## Nehemiah 8:2 (#1) (id: 273350)

**"Ezra the priest"**

This information serves to introduce Ezra further. In addition to being a teacher and learned student of the Law of Moses, he was also a priest whose duties would have included offering sacrifices in the temple and helping people make sure they were following the law in everyday matters. It might be helpful to your readers to explain that here because it shows why Ezra would have been such an effective teacher for everyone on this occasion. Alternate translation: “Ezra was also a priest who served in the temple and helped people follow the law” (See: Introduction of New and Old Participants)

## Nehemiah 8:3 (#5) (id: 273359)

**"from the light until the middle of the day"**

Verse [8:7](https://ref.ly/Neh8:7) explains that other teachers circulated within the crowd to answer questions that people had about what Ezra was reading. It is unlikely that they did this while he was still talking. Instead, he probably paused from time to time to allow this. So this expression is actually referring to a whole time period by describing its beginning and ending, but it does not mean that the activity took place without interruption the whole time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “throughout the morning”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 8:8

## Nehemiah 8:8 (#2) (id: 273381)

**"carefully"**

The exact meaning of this Hebrew term is unknown. This expression could mean that the Levites read loudly and clearly so that the groups they were talking to within the crowd could hear and understand them. It could also mean that they went over one section at a time with the people, after Ezra had read that section to everyone. It might also imply that the people could not understand the language in which the book of the Law was written, so the Levites needed to interpret it into the language that the people could understand.

The implication is that if a person is truly sorry for disobeying, Yahweh does not want that person to fear punishment or to grieve for the way they have offended. Instead, Yahweh wants them to be encouraged that they can live in a new way and to be happy about that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly.

**"caused all the people to be silent"**

These are two overstatements that emphasize how encouraging the Levites were trying to be. **All the people** does not mean everyone in the crowd, but those who were crying. **Be silent** does not mean “say nothing” or “make no noise,” but “stop crying.” (Certainly the Levites hoped that these people would soon be talking and laughing with others at celebration meals.)

## Nehemiah 8:13 (#7) (id: 273426)

**"even to give attention to the words of the law"**

The implication is that while the people realized this, they also realized it would not be practical for large crowds to gather in Jerusalem every day so that all the people could receive Ezra’s teaching at once. Instead, they asked the family and religious leaders in Judah to meet with Ezra and learn from him so that they could then pass the teachings along. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people realized that they needed to understand God’s law much better, so they asked their family and religious leaders to meet with Ezra and learn more things from him that they could then pass along.”

Because it was already the seventh month, it seems likely that Ezra showed this passage to the leaders intentionally because it was something they could and should obey immediately.

**"that the sons of Israel should live in huts during the feast in the seventh month"**

Nehemiah 9 General Notes
========================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

This chapter and the next one form a single section.

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Prayer to God

The people prayed and thanked God for his care for them and the blessings he gave to them. They also confessed their sin of disobeying him. (See: Bless and Confess and Sin)

### Learning from their ancestor’s mistakes

This chapter teaches that the Jews learned from the mistakes of their ancestors. They became determined to worship Yahweh alone, to not intermarry with other peoples, and to worship Yahweh as the law of Moses instructed them. (See: Law of Moses)

### Recalling the great power of God

It was common to recall the great things God did for Israel. This is a reminder to Israel of God’s power. It is intended to bring the people to repentance and proper worship of Yahweh. (See: Repent)

## Nehemiah 9:1 (#1) (id: 273463)

**"And on day 24 of this month"**

**This month** means the seventh month of that year according to the Hebrew calendar, as specified in [8:2](https://ref.ly/Neh8:2) and [8:14](https://ref.ly/Neh8:14). The Law of Moses said to observe the Festival of Tabernacles from the fifteenth through the twenty\-second days of that month. The implication is that after that joyful celebration, the people were given one full day to rest and prepare for the gathering that this chapter describes. It had a different and more solemn purpose. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “On the twenty\-fourth day of the seventh month of that year, two days after the joyful Festival of Tabernacles had ended”

* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 9:1 (#4) (id: 273466)

**"the sons of Israel were gathered"**

The implication is that people from all the cities and towns the province of Judah gathered together again in Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “people from all over Judah gathered together again in Jerusalem”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 9:1 (#5) (id: 273467)

**"the sons of Israel"**

**Sons** here means “descendants.” In this context it includes both men and women, and it refers specifically to the Israelites who were now living in Judah. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” or “people from all over Judah”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 9:1 (#6) (id: 273468)

**"and in sackcloth, and dust was upon them"**

The people did these things to show symbolically how sorry they were for their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people refrained from eating, wore rough clothing, and put dust on their heads to show that they were sorry for their sins”

See: Symbolic Action

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:1
* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Action (ID: 33402)

## Nehemiah 9:1 (#7) (id: 273469)

**"and dust was upon them"**

**Them** in this sentence refers to the people, but it does not mean that they covered themselves entirely in dust. The story is using the whole person to refer to one part of the person, the head, which is where people in this culture put dust to express sorrow. Alternate translation: “the people … put dust on their heads”

## Nehemiah 9:2 (#1) (id: 273470)

**"And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all the sons of a foreigner"**

The Israelites were conducting this ceremony as a special act of repentance for how they and their ancestors had disobeyed God. They were acknowledging how they had failed to fulfill the special assignment God had given them of modeling the blessings of living according to his ways, so it would not have been appropriate for people from other nations to take part in the ceremony. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people of Israel did not allow anyone from any other nation to take part in this ceremony because it was going to be a time of repentance for how they and their ancestors had disobeyed Yahweh”

## Nehemiah 9:2 (#2) (id: 273471)

**"the seed of Israel"**

Here, **seed** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “the Israelites”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:2
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 9:2 (#3) (id: 273472)

**"from all the sons of a foreigner"**

**Sons** here means **descendants.** Alternate translation: “all people from other nations”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 9:2 (#4) (id: 273473)

**"And they stood, and they confessed concerning their sins and the iniquities of their fathers"**

Here, **stood** probably does not mean “standing up,” since the next verse says that they “rose up,” which probably means that they got up from kneeling. As they were showing sorrow for their sins, they would likely have knelt to worship God, as in [8:6](https://ref.ly/Neh8:6). So **stood** probably means instead that they remained in place, by implication for some time, and made a thorough confession. Alternate translation: “they remained in place as they confessed all the wrong things that they and their ancestors had done”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 9:2 (#5) (id: 273474)

**"their fathers"**

**Fathers** here means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “their ancestors”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 9:3 (#1) (id: 273475)

**"And they rose up in their place"**

**Rose up** here likely means **stood up.** As in [8:5](https://ref.ly/Neh8:5), the people would have stood up to show respect as they listened to the reading from the Law of Moses. Alternate translation: “Then the people stood up where they were”

See: Symbolic Action

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:3
* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Action (ID: 33402)

## Nehemiah 9:3 (#2) (id: 273476)

**"and they read aloud the book of"**

The people themselves did not read from the book. **They** here likely means Ezra and the Levites, who read similarly to the crowd that gathered on the occasion described in 8:1–12\. Alternate translation: “as their leaders read to them”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:3

## Nehemiah 9:3 (#3) (id: 273477)

**"the book of the law of Yahweh their God"**

This is another of the various ways that this story describes a book containing the Law of Moses. Alternate translation: “from the Law of Moses” or “from the law that Yahweh had given through Moses”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:3
* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: 33408)

## Nehemiah 9:3 (#4) (id: 273478)

**"a fourth of the day, and a fourth of the day"**

In this culture the day and the night were each divided into four equal parts of three hours each. So this means that the people listened to a reading of the Law for three hours, and then they spent the next three hours in prayer and confession. Alternate translation: “for three hours, and then for another three hours”

## Nehemiah 9:4 (#1) (id: 273479)

**"And Jeshua rose up on the stairs of the Levites, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Kenani"**

The name of the stairs suggests that the men listed were Levites. That is, they were descendants of Levi who had the special assignment of helping the priests. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could suggest this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Eight Levites named Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani climbed up the stairs leading to the platform”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 9:4 (#2) (id: 273480)

**"And"** \- **"rose up on the stairs of the Levites"**

In context, the **stairs of the Levites** seem to be stairs that led up to the platform that was built for the occasion described in chapter 8, or to another platform or platforms similar to it that allowed religious leaders to be seen and heard during large gatherings. The stairs likely had this name because they enabled the Levites to move back and forth from up on the platform to down among the people. Here, they also serve as a raised platform of their own on which the Levites can stand and be seen and heard. Alternate translation: “climbed up onto the stairs to the platform” or “the stairs that had been built for the Levites”

See: Translate Unknowns

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:4
* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: 33408)

## Nehemiah 9:4 (#3) (id: 273481)

**"And"** \- **"rose up on"**

**Rose up** in this context seems to mean that these men climbed up onto the stairs and stood on them. Alternate translation: “climbed up onto”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 9:4 (#4) (id: 273482)

**"And"** \- **"rose up"**

It seems that in this verse the story is describing something that happened during the second three\-hour period, at the same time as the people were praying and confessing. You could indicate this with an introductory phrase. Alternate translation: “While the people were doing this”

See: Connect — Simultaneous Time Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:4
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Simultaneous Time Relationship (ID: 33334)

## Nehemiah 9:4 (#5) (id: 273483)

**"Jeshua"** \- **"and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Kenani"**

These are the names of eight men.

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 9:4 (#6) (id: 273484)

**"And they cried out with a loud voice to Yahweh their God"**

The implication is that they did this to offer public prayers of confession on behalf of the people, and perhaps also to guide the people to pray themselves on particular topics. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “They prayed to Yahweh their God on behalf of the people, speaking loudly so that everyone could hear them.”

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#1) (id: 273485)

**"the Levites"**

This phrase indicates that the eight men listed were Levites. If you said in your translation that the eight men listed in [8:4](https://ref.ly/Neh8:4) were also Levites, here you could say, “Eight more Levites named.”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:5

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#2) (id: 273486)

**"Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah"**

These are the names of eight men.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:5
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#3) (id: 273487)

**"Rise up"**

Here, **rise up** seems to mean “get up from a kneeling posture.” This would have symbolized that a new part of the ceremony was beginning. The people were to move from sorrowful confession to a resolute and joyful rededication of their community to God.

See: Symbolic Action

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:5
* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Action (ID: 33402)

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#4) (id: 273488)

**"Bless Yahweh your God from eternity to eternity"**

The Levites speak these words to the people. They are not telling the people to praise God during all the time from eternity past to eternity future. Rather, they are using an idiom, “from eternity to eternity,” to mean that Yahweh is the God who has always existed and will always exist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put it in those terms. Alternate translation: “Praise Yahweh, your God, who has always existed and will always exist”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#5) (id: 273489)

**"And may they bless your glorious name"**

In this sentence, the Levite who is speaking turns abruptly from addressing the people to addressing God. (**Your** in the previous sentence meant the people, while **your** here refers to God.) This is somewhat like the places earlier in the book where Nehemiah stops addressing his readers and speaks directly to God in prayer. However, here the people are meant to hear and do what is being described. So If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these as words that continue to be directed to the people, as in the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “Praise his glorious name”

See: Aside

* **Associated Articles:** Aside (ID: 33260)

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#6) (id: 273490)

**"And may they bless your glorious name"**

As in [1:9](https://ref.ly/Neh1:9), **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. This is described by something associated with it, how well known someone’s name is and how people react to hearing it. God’s reputation, in turn, is based on what he has done and what this reveals about who he is, and so his “name” would also represent that. Alternate translation: “praise you for who you are and what you have done”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#7) (id: 273491)

**"which is exalted above all blessing and praise"**

Here God’s name is described in a spatial metaphor as being higher than or lifted up above blessing and praise. This means that all of the things that people could do to honor and praise God could never be sufficient to acknowledge how much honor and praise he actually deserves. Alternate translation: “we can never bless you and praise you as much as you deserve”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#8) (id: 273492)

**"above all blessing and praise"**

**Blessing** and **praise** are abstract nouns that refer to the act of openly honoring someone for their character and actions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind these words with the verb forms of these words. Alternate translation: “we can never bless you and praise you as much as you deserve”

## Nehemiah 9:5 (#9) (id: 273493)

**"above all blessing and praise"**

In this context, **blessing** and **praise** mean basically the same thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these words. Alternate translation: “we can never acknowledge you sufficiently”

## Nehemiah 9:6 (#1) (id: 273494)

**"You alone are he, Yahweh"**

At the end of the previous verse, the Levites started speaking to God, but they still meant for the people to hear their words and do what they said. Now the Levites are addressing God directly in prayer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this with an introductory phrase. Alternate translation: “Then these Levites prayed to God and said, ‘Yahweh, you are the only true God”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 9:6 (#2) (id: 273495)

**"You alone are he, Yahweh"**

This means **you alone are the one** or **you are the only one.** Alternate translation: “You, Yahweh, are the only true God”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 9:6 (#3) (id: 273496)

**"the heavens, the heavens of the heavens"**

In the ancient Hebrew cosmology, the first phrase likely referred to the sky, which was envisioned as a solid dome above the earth (See: the note to [1:9](https://ref.ly/Neh1:9)). The second phrase likely referred to the realm beyond the sky, which was understood to be the dwelling place of God. Alternate translation: “the sky and everything beyond it”

* **Associated Articles:** Translate Unknowns (ID: 33408)

## Nehemiah 9:6 (#4) (id: 273497)

**"and all their host"**

**Host** means army. The “host of heaven” is likely a figurative expression for the stars, which seem like a large army in the sky. However, this phrase might refer to heavenly beings which dwell in heaven with God. Alternate translation: “and all the stars”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:6
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 9:6 (#5) (id: 273498)

**"and you cause all of them to live"**

**Them** means everything living on the land and in the seas. Alternate translation: “You give life to all of these creatures” or “you are the one who created all of these living things”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:6

## Nehemiah 9:6 (#6) (id: 273499)

**"and the host of the heavens prostrates themselves to you"**

Earlier in the sentence, the **host of heaven** was a figurative way of describing the stars as if they were an army. Now here, the stars themselves represent the angels of heaven. Alternate translation: “all the angels bow down and worship you”

## Nehemiah 9:7 (#1) (id: 273500)

**"You are he, Yahweh, the God who chose Abram"**

Alternate translation: “You, Yahweh, are the God who chose Abram”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:7

## Nehemiah 9:7 (#2) (id: 273501)

**"chose Abram"**

Abram was the ancestor of the Israelites. God chose to make him and his descendants a community that would model for the whole world the blessings of living according to his ways. The Levites mention this first because it is the very beginning of the Israelites’ history as God’s chosen people. They will describe the rest of this history, up to their present day, in the rest of their prayer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this. Alternate translation: “chose Abram to be the ancestor of your people”

**"Also, you brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees"**

Throughout their prayer, the Levites assume that the people listening will understand the significance of the details they mention for the Israelites’ history as God’s chosen people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why God brought Abram out of this city. Alternate translation: “He was living among the Chaldean people in the city of Ur, but you told him to leave there and go to a land that you would give to his descendants”

Once again the Levites assume that their listeners will understand the significance of this detail.

## Nehemiah 9:8 (#4) (id: 273509)

**"and cut with him the covenant"**

To **cut** a covenant is a Hebrew idiom for making a solemn agreement with a person. The expression comes from the way animals were cut into pieces during covenant ceremonies to show what the parties wanted God to do to anyone who broke the agreement. But the meaning here is idiomatic. It is not a direct reference to such a ceremony, but only to the making of the covenant. Alternate translation: “you made an agreement with him” or “you made a promise to him”

**"and you have caused your words to stand"**

As in [5:13](https://ref.ly/Neh5:13), **words** means the promises that God made to Abraham, and **stand** means stay in place rather than go away.

## Nehemiah 9:9 (#1) (id: 273514)

**"And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and you heard their cry at the sea of reeds"**

Here the Levites are describing how, centuries later, God rescued their ancestors, Abraham’s descendants, from slavery in Egypt. In this verse they describe that entire experience generally by reference to its first episode and its final episode, to include everything in between. (In [9:10](https://ref.ly/Neh9:10) and [9:11](https://ref.ly/Neh9:11) they will add further specific details.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could describe the entire experience in a single phrase here. (However, you could also explain these episodes separately. See the next two notes.) Alternate translation: “You rescued our fathers from slavery in Egypt by defeating Pharaoh”

## Nehemiah 9:9 (#2) (id: 273515)

**"And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt"**

**Affliction** is an abstract noun that refers to the way the Israelites suffered when Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, forced them to serve him as slaves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with a verb such as “suffer.” Alternate translation: “you saw how badly our ancestors were suffering as slaves in Egypt”

**"And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt"**

The implication is that God not only saw how the Israelites were suffering, but also was moved to action out of compassion for them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you saw how badly our ancestors were suffering as slaves in Egypt, and so you delivered them from slavery”

## Nehemiah 9:9 (#5) (id: 273518)

**"and you heard their cry at the sea of reeds"**

The Levites continue to rehearse the details of Israelite history without explaining their significance because they assume their listeners will already understand this. This is a reference to something that happened after God had freed their ancestors from slavery and they had left Egypt. Pharaoh regretted letting them go and pursued them with his army. Helplessly trapped against the shores of the Red Sea as Pharaoh’s army approached, the Israelites cried out to God for rescue. Alternate translation: “you answered their prayer when they cried to you for help from the shores of the Red Sea”

**"And you gave them into their hands, and their kings, and the peoples of the land, to do with them according to their will"**

The Levites continue to recount details of Israelite history and assume that their listeners will understand the significance of these details. This sentence means, “You gave the Canaanites into the hands of the Israelites, that is, you gave their kings and the Canaanite people into the hands of the Israelites.” The implication is that once the Israelites had defeated the armies that the kings were leading, they could then do anything they wanted with the people who were living in the land. In other words, Yahweh gave the kings “into their hands” by defeating them, and as a result, the people were “in their hands” to do with whatever they wanted. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You enabled them to defeat the armies that the Canaanite kings were leading, and then they could do whatever they wanted with the people of Canaan”

## Nehemiah 9:31 (#2) (id: 273639)

**"But, in your many mercies"**

As in [9:27](https://ref.ly/Neh9:27), alternate translation: “because you are very merciful”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 9:31

## Nehemiah 9:31 (#3) (id: 273640)

**"you did not make a complete end of them, and you did not forsake them"**

These two phrases do not describe separate things. They mean something similar. They describe what the people deserved for refusing to obey Yahweh. The first phrase describes what the people would have experienced in their lives. They would have been completely destroyed. The second phrase describes what they would have experienced in their relationship with Yahweh. He would have given up on them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “You did not abandon them to complete destruction”

## Nehemiah 9:31 (#5) (id: 273642)

**"gracious and merciful"**

**Gracious** and **merciful** mean similar things. The Levites use them together to emphasize that God did not punish the Israelites the way they deserved. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that would make the meaning less clear for your readers. Alternate translation: “very merciful”

## Nehemiah 9:32 (#1) (id: 273643)

**"So now"**

This phrase indicates that the Levites believe that what they are about to ask for should be the results of what they have just described. Specifically, because he is merciful, God helped the Israelites in the past even though they did not deserve it. And so the Levites are praying for God to be merciful and help the Israelites now even though they do not deserve it. Alternate translation: “and that is why we are praying this now”

## Nehemiah 9:32 (#2) (id: 273644)

**"the great, mighty, and fearsome God"**

As in [1:5](https://ref.ly/Neh1:5), **great** and **fearsome** mean similar things. “Mighty” also means something similar. The Levites use all of these words together to emphasize how much respect God deserves. You do not need to repeat all three words in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also bring that out in your translation. “Great” and “mighty” refer to how powerful God is objectively. “Fearsome” reflects how people should respond to God’s greatness subjectively. They should “fear” God. This does not mean that they should be afraid of him, but that they should show him respect and reverence. Alternate translation: “the God who deserves total respect” (A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.)

## Nehemiah 9:32 (#3) (id: 273645)

**"who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness"**

As in [1:5](https://ref.ly/Neh1:5), **covenant** and **covenant faithfulness** mean similar things. The Levites said the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how certain it is that God will keep his promises. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could bring that out in your translation even if you combine the phrases. The “covenant” is God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants. “Covenant faithfulness” is a character quality of God. He is inwardly disposed to keep all of his promises, and he always does so faithfully. So you could say something like, “you always keep your promises faithfully because of who you are.”

**"do not let all the hardship be little before your face"**

As in [9:28](https://ref.ly/Neh9:28), **face** refers to a person’s opinion or judgment, by association with the way they use the eyes in their face to see things and the way their facial expression shows what they think of those things. So the Levites would be praying that God would not regard their suffering as insignificant. Alternate translation: “do not regard our sufferings as insignificant”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “These are the names of the Levites who signed the covenant. First, their leaders”

This could mean one of two things. (1\) It could be referring to people from other nations who had converted and become Jews. Alternate translation: “people from other nations who had become Jews and would now obey the law of God” (2\) It might not be a reference to a distinct group, but rather a description of something that was true of everyone from any of the previously named groups who agreed to the covenant. As in [9:2](https://ref.ly/Neh9:2), it would be a description of how the Israelites needed to reject the influence and practices of other people groups in order to follow the law of God faithfully.

This could mean one of several things. (1\) As in [5:7–12](https://ref.ly/Neh5:7-Neh5:12), it could be a promise not to charge any interest on loans to fellow Israelites.

**"a third of a shekel"**

In ancient times, a silver shekel weighed about 11 grams or about a third of an ounce. You could try to express this in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate over time since those values can change from year to year. Instead, you could give the equivalent weight or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note.

**"And in the cities of Judah"**

This sentence explains a contrasting idea before the story goes on to develop the idea that the previous sentence introduces. This chapter is a list of the provincial leaders, priests, Levites, gatekeepers, temple servants, and singers who lived in Jerusalem. The previous sentence introduces the first part of that list, but before the list gives the names of the provincial leaders, it explains that most of the people who had returned to the province of Judah kept on living on their ancestral lands in other cities and towns. You could begin this sentence with a word like “but” to indicate this contrast.

This sentence provides further information about the situation the book is describing here. In addition to the people who were living in various other cities and towns in the province of Judah, there were other people already living in Jerusalem.

In [11:21–24](https://ref.ly/Neh11:21-Neh11:24) the list gave additional details about some other things, but it is now returning to speak about those cities and towns outside of Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 11:25 (#6) (id: 273915)

**"in Kiriath Arba and its daughters; and in Dibon and its daughters; and in Jekabzeel and its villages"**

In this context, referring to the **daughters** of a town is a figurative way of describing the small communities that have grown up around it. (These communities were likely started by people from the town, and they depended on the town the way a child depends on a parent.) Here and in verses [27](https://ref.ly/Neh11:27), [28](https://ref.ly/Neh11:28), [30](https://ref.ly/Neh11:30), and [31](https://ref.ly/Neh11:31), use whatever term would convey this concept most clearly in your language. But be careful to distinguish between this term and the one that is used generally for the places in this part of the list. For example, if you translate “daughters” as “villages,” then use a word like “town” for the places named on the list and other places that the list describes with the same word. Alternate translation: “in Kiriath Arba and its villages, in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and the surrounding towns.”

**"and some from the Levites, who were divisions of Judah, in Benjamin"**

Here the list is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning seems to be that certain sections of the Levite community that had previously lived in the territory that had belonged to the tribe of Judah went to live in the territory that had belonged to the tribe of Benjamin rather than returning to their former homeland. Alternate translation: “some of the Levites whose families had lived in the territory of Judah now went to live in the territory of Benjamin”

**"and some from the Levites, who were divisions of Judah, in Benjamin"**

The book does not say explicitly why these Levites moved to a different area. However, one reasonable inference in light of the overall themes of the book of Nehemiah is that they did this so that there would be people throughout the entire area where the Israelites were living who could explain the law to them. If that would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “some of the Levites whose families had lived in the territory of Judah now went to live in the territory of Benjamin so that they could teach God’s law to the people living there”

## Nehemiah - Chapter 12 Introduction (id: 718684)

Nehemiah 12 General Notes
=========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Dedication of the wall

In the ancient Near East, it was common to dedicate an important structure to a god. When it was completed, the wall was dedicated to Yahweh. Long lists of people are present, indicating that “everyone” was present for this and praised Yahweh. (See: False God)

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:1
* **Associated Articles:** False God (ID: 26586)

## Nehemiah 12:1 (#1) (id: 273937)

**"And these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua"**

The implication of the list in verses 1–25 of this chapter is that the priests and Levites had dependable records of their ancestry. So when Nehemiah called them back into service for the dedication of the wall and the collection of offerings, as described in the rest of this chapter, he was employing the people with exactly the lineage that the law required. Throughout this book, Nehemiah stresses how he made sure that the people of Judah were not only organized and well\-protected, but also obedient to the law. This is one more example of that latter concern. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Here is a record that shows that the priests and Levites had dependable records of their ancestry. It begins with the priests who first returned to Judah with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, their governor, and with Joshua the high priest.”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 12:1

## Nehemiah 12:1 (#2) (id: 273938)

**"came up"**

As in [7:6](https://ref.ly/Neh7:6) and [7:61](https://ref.ly/Neh7:61), **went up** means “traveled from Babylon back to Judah,” since that involves going from a river valley up into the mountains. Alternate translation: “returned to Judah from Babylon”

This was the man who led the first group of Jews who returned to the province of Judah about a hundred years before the time of Nehemiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this more explicitly. Alternate translation: “under the leadership of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, their governor”

## Nehemiah 12:7 (#4) (id: 273952)

**"the heads of the priests and their brothers"**

In this context, **and** means “that is,” so the full expression means, “the leaders of the priests, that is, the ones who were their ‘brothers.’” **Brothers** itself is a figurative way of saying “fellow priests,” and in this context specifically means “the priests in their own divisions.” (King David had divided the priests into divisions so that they could rotate their responsibilities, and the Israelites reconstituted these divisions after the exile.) It is possible that some of the people in each division were the biological brothers of the leaders named, since the divisions were created based on close kinship ties, but the word “brother” is essentially figurative.

**"Darius the Persian"**

The Persian king named Darius who reigned at the time of Jaddua, the last high priest mentioned in this verse, was Darius III Codomannus. The implication is therefore that the phrase “Darius the Persian” refers to him. (Since he reigned about a hundred years after Nehemiah lived, it is probable that scribes added this information to the book later on to bring it up to date.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this likely identification explicit. Alternate translation: “Darius III” or “Darius Codomannus” or “Darius III Codomannus”

**Johanan** is the name of a man. The context indicates that he was a Jewish high priest, and so he seems to be the same man who is called “Jonathan” in verse 11\. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the same name both here and in verse 11, either “Johanan” or “Jonathan”

## Nehemiah 12:24 (#5) (id: 274012)

**"with their brothers opposite them, service watch by service watch"**

As in [12:9](https://ref.ly/Neh12:9), this could mean one of two things. (1\) It could mean that Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua directed one choir, and other Levite leaders directed a second choir that stood opposite to this first one and sang responses to what it sang. (2\) It could mean that other Levite leaders took turns with these three men in assuming the responsibilities of directing a single Levite choir. Alternate translation: “their fellow Levite leaders directed a second choir that sang responses” or “their fellow Levite leaders took turns with them directing the choir”

**"were guardians, gatekeepers, a guard at the storehouses of the gates"**

Since, in context, these men appear to have been Levites, the **gates** described are likely the gates of the temple. It seems that there were rooms above the temple gateways that were used as storehouses or treasuries, and these men were responsible for overseeing and protecting them. Alternate translation: “guarded the store rooms above the gateways to the temple”

## Nehemiah 12:27 (#1) (id: 274024)

**"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem"**

In this book, Nehemiah tells his personal story from [1:1](https://ref.ly/Neh1:1) through [7:5](https://ref.ly/Neh7:5). In that story, he explains how he was concerned not just to restore the city of Jerusalem physically by rebuilding its wall, but also to restore its population by bringing in people who were genuine Israelites, and to restore worship by making sure that the priests and Levites who were doing assigned tasks had dependable records of their ancestry. He includes the long series of lists from [7:6](https://ref.ly/Neh7:6) through [12:26](https://ref.ly/Neh12:26) to document that these priests, Levites, and Israelites had the lineage that the Law of Moses required. Now Nehemiah resumes his personal story, and he tells what he did next. He organized a worship ceremony to dedicate the city wall. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put some introductory and transitional sentence here to show how the book is progressing. Alternate translation: “once we had brought many more Israelites to live in Jerusalem, and once we had established the priests and Levites in their tasks, we held a ceremony to dedicate the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem”

## Nehemiah 12:27 (#2) (id: 274025)

**"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem"**

The abstract noun **dedication** refers to the way the wall would be set apart for a special purpose. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “set apart.” Alternate translation: “to set apart the wall of Jerusalem for a special purpose”

**"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem"**

Dedicating the wall was a symbolic way of dedicating, or rather rededicating, the entire city to the special purpose that God had chosen it for. The rebuilt wall now defined Jerusalem once again as a distinct place, the place from which God had chosen to start making himself famous throughout the world. Alternate translation: “to set apart the wall of Jerusalem for a special purpose, to show that God had set apart the city for a special purpose”

## Nehemiah 12:27 (#4) (id: 274027)

**"they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to perform the dedication"**

**All their places** means all the other places in the province of Judah besides Jerusalem where the Levites were living. As [11:20](https://ref.ly/Neh11:20) explained, other than the people who agreed to settle in Jerusalem, all of the other Israelites, including the Levites, lived on their family properties in other cities and towns in the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “we brought the Levites back to Jerusalem from all the places where they were living so that they could take part in the dedication ceremony”

**"they sought out"**

**They** refers to the people who organized the dedication ceremony.

**"the sons of the ones who sang"**

As in [3:8](https://ref.ly/Neh3:8) and [3:31](https://ref.ly/Neh3:31), **son of** here is a figurative expression that indicates that a person shares the qualities of something. In this case, the book is describing people who share the quality of being singers. (Verse [12:27](https://ref.ly/Neh12:27) indicates that these were specifically Levites.)

This sentence draws a contrast between the joyful celebration that is about to begin in this part of the story and the solemn ceremony that the priests and Levites performed beforehand. You could begin the sentence with a phrase such as “but first” to indicate this contrast. Alternate translation: “But first the priests and Levites performed a ceremony to make themselves clean, and they did the same thing for the people, the gates, and the wall”

## Nehemiah 12:30 (#2) (id: 274043)

**"And"** \- **"purified themselves"**

Nehemiah expects his readers to know specifically how the priests and Levites did this, but the details are no longer certain. They may have sprinkled themselves, the people, the gates, and the walls with water or with blood, or they may have offered sacrifices. But while the details are uncertain, the purpose of the ceremony is clear. It was to show that the Israelites wanted this place and everyone in it to be acceptable to God. So while it might be best not to suggest how the priests and Levites performed this ceremony, since that is unknown, you could say explicitly what the purpose was if that would be helpful to your readers.

## Nehemiah 12:31 (#2) (id: 274045)

**"And I caused the officials of Judah to go up on top of the wall. And I caused to stand two great thanksgiving groups, and processions"**

The implication here, which is confirmed in [12:32](https://ref.ly/Neh12:32) and [12:40](https://ref.ly/Neh12:40), is that Nehemiah had these leaders of Judah go up onto the wall so that they could accompany two large groups that would “process” or march around the city on top of the wall while giving thanks to God. They would march in opposite directions and meet up on the far side of the city. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like that explicitly.

**"two great thanksgiving groups, and processions"**

Having two groups walk on top of the wall in opposite directions all around Jerusalem, while sacred musicians played music was a symbolic way of dedicating the rebuilt wall to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could also say that explicitly.

**"and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam"**

Based on what [12:33–36](https://ref.ly/Neh12:33-Neh12:36) says about the composition of this group, it appears that Ezra walked in front of it ([12:36](https://ref.ly/Neh12:36)), Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah walked behind it ([12:32](https://ref.ly/Neh12:32)), and the group itself was made up of a large number of people from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, along with the other leaders who are named, and priests playing musical instruments. In that case, the word **and** would be indicating this sentence, which continues through to most of verse [12:36](https://ref.ly/Neh12:36), will provide further information about the situation the book has been describing.

The implication, which the original audience of the book would apparently have understood, is that when this first procession reached the place described, rather than continue walking on the wall, which was about to follow a winding course around a hill, they took these stairs straight up the hill, and they rejoined the wall at the place where it went up to the top of the hill. Alternate translation: “When they reached the Fountain Gate, they left the wall and went up the stairs that were in front of them that led to the City of David. They came back onto the wall at the place where it reached the top of the hill they had just climbed”

## Nehemiah 12:37 (#4) (id: 274068)

**"on top of the house of David"**

This means that as the group walked on the top of the wall once again, at this point they were higher than this palace where David had lived. (In [3:25](https://ref.ly/Neh3:25) this same building is called “the upper house of the king,” meaning the royal palace that was located in a more elevated part of the city.)

**"and as far as the gate of water, east"**

Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. This sentence is indicating that once this group reached the Water Gate, it stopped. This left them just to the east of the temple. As [12:39](https://ref.ly/Neh12:39) explains, the other group stopped just to the west of the temple, and the two groups joined together in the temple area. Alternate translation: “until they reached the Water Gate, and there they stopped, on the east side of the temple”

## Nehemiah 12:39 (#4) (id: 274080)

**"and they stood in the gate of the guard"**

This is apparently the name of one of the gates of the Jerusalem temple. Verse [3:25](https://ref.ly/Neh3:25) describes repairs that were made to the wall near the “court of the guard,” which was in the temple precincts, so presumably this was the gate that led into that court. “Stood” means “stood still,” that is, “stopped moving.” The people were already standing up to walk. Alternate translation: “This second group stopped when it reached the Gate of the Guard”

**"And they kept the service watch of their God and the service watch of purification"**

**They** means the priests and Levites. The abstract noun **service**, in the phrase **service watch of their God**, refers to the duties that God had commanded the priests and Levites to perform in the law. In the phrase “service of purification,” this abstract noun refers to one of those duties in particular, the duty of performing a ceremony for themselves and for others that expressed a desire to be ceremonially clean, that is, acceptable to God. The story describes in [12:30](https://ref.ly/Neh12:30) how they performed such a ceremony on this occasion.

## Nehemiah 12:47 (#8) (id: 274119)

**"And they were consecrating for the Levites, and the Levites were consecrating for the sons of Aaron"**

**They** means the Israelites, as in the previous sentence. **Consecrating** means **setting apart.** This is likely a reference to the tithe or 1/10 of crops that the Israelites promised in their covenant to give to support the Levites, and to the tithe of this tithe that the Levites then contributed to support the priests, as described in [10:37–38](https://ref.ly/Neh10:37-Neh10:38). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The Israelites also gave a tenth of their crops to support the Levites, just as they had promised, and the Levites gave a tenth of this tenth to support the priests”

## Nehemiah - Chapter 13 Introduction (id: 718685)

Nehemiah 13 General Notes
=========================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem

Nehemiah was eager to make sure that the Jews kept their promise to obey the law. When he returned from Persia, he found many things wrong: one of the store rooms in the temple had been converted into a guest room for Tobiah, the Levites had not received their portions for working in the temple, people were working on the Sabbath, and many had married heathen wives. (See: Promise, Law of Moses and Temple and Sabbath)

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1
* **Associated Articles:** Law of Moses (ID: 26817); Promise (ID: 26985); Sabbath (ID: 27044); Temple (ID: 27142)

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#1) (id: 274120)

**"On that day"**

As noted for [12:43](https://ref.ly/Neh12:43) and [12:44](https://ref.ly/Neh12:44), this is a flexible expression that can mean either “on that same day” or “around that time.” Either meaning might fit the context here, so you could choose to say either one in your translation.

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#2) (id: 274121)

**"it was read in the book of Moses"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we read from the scroll that contained the Law of Moses”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#3) (id: 274122)

**"in the ears of the people"**

Here, **ears** stand for hearing. Alternate translation: “out loud so that all the people could hear”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#4) (id: 274123)

**"and it was found written in it"**

**Found** is an idiom that means “could be found there” or “was there.” The expression means that this was something that was in the law. And since Nehemiah and the other leaders were reading this out loud to the people, their purpose was to show them that this was in the law. Alternate translation: “and we showed them that it said”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#5) (id: 274124)

**"and it was found written in it"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we showed them that it said”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#6) (id: 274125)

**"Ammonite or Moabite"**

These are the names of the members of two people groups.

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#7) (id: 274126)

**"shall enter into the assembly of God"**

The expression **assembly of God** can refer either to the entire Israelite community, as in [7:66](https://ref.ly/Neh7:66) and [8:17](https://ref.ly/Neh8:17), or to the community gathered for a legal proceeding, as in [5:7](https://ref.ly/Neh5:7) and [5:13](https://ref.ly/Neh5:13), or gathered for a religious ceremony, as in [8:2](https://ref.ly/Neh8:2) and [8:18](https://ref.ly/Neh8:18). The last meaning is probably in view here. This statement likely means that Ammonites and Moabites were not allowed to join the Israelites in their worship of Yahweh in the temple or on public occasions. For example, [9:2](https://ref.ly/Neh9:2) describes how the Israelites did not allow any foreigners to take part in their ceremony of national repentance. (Later in this chapter, in [13:23–27](https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:27), Nehemiah will describe how he took the further measure of expelling foreigners from the Israelite community itself.) Alternate translation: “could join with the Israelites when they worshiped Yahweh”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:1 (#8) (id: 274127)

**"until eternity"**

This expression means that this was a permanent regulation in the Law of Moses. It was not a regulation that applied just to a specific period and that might change afterwards. Alternate translation: “This was a permanent rule.”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:1
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:2 (#1) (id: 274128)

**"For"**

This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the reasons for what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “they could not come into the assembly because”

* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship (ID: 33331)

## Nehemiah 13:2 (#2) (id: 274129)

**"they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and with water"**

The assumption is that readers will know what historical incident this statement is referring to. It is a reference to the time when the Israelites were traveling from Egypt to Canaan through the desert. They were basically refugees. It could have been expected, as a basic act of compassion, that the Ammonites and Moabites would help provide for their needs as they passed through their territories but they refused to do this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they did not help meet the needs of the Israelites when they were refugees traveling through their territories”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Nehemiah 13:2 (#3) (id: 274130)

**"the sons of Israel"**

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 13:2 (#4) (id: 274131)

**"they did"** \- **"meet"** \- **"with bread and with water"**

Bread stands for food, and water stands for drink, and together both terms probably represent assistance in general. Alternate translation: “provide food and drink” or “provide the help they needed”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Nehemiah 13:2 (#5) (id: 274132)

**"And he hired Balaam against them to curse them, but our God overturned the curse to a blessing"**

The assumption once again is that readers will know what historical incident this is referring to. This is a reference to the way the king of Moab hired a prophet named Balaam to curse the Israelites, but instead God made Balaam speak words of blessing about them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The Moabites also hired a prophet named Balaam to curse the Israelites, but God made him speak words of blessing instead”

## Nehemiah 13:3 (#1) (id: 274134)

**"And it happened"**

This phrase indicates that the events the story will now describe came after the things it has just described. You can use an expression in your own language that will indicate this clearly.

See: Connect — Sequential Time Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:3
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Sequential Time Relationship (ID: 33333)

## Nehemiah 13:3 (#2) (id: 274135)

**"as soon as they heard the law"**

As in [9:29](https://ref.ly/Neh9:29), **hear** in this context is an idiom that means not just to hear something audibly, but to understand a command and recognize the need to obey it. Alternate translation: “when they realized that this was what the law commanded”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:3 (#3) (id: 274136)

**"that,"** \- **"they separated all the mixed company from Israel"**

**Mixed company** is an expression that describes people who were not Israelites. It indicates that if they were present, then the group would be mixed, part Israelite and part non\-Israelite. Alternate translation: “They no longer allowed foreigners to worship with the Israelites”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#1) (id: 274137)

**"Now, before the face of this"**

This phrase indicates that the events the story will now relate came before the events it has just described. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “but before all this happened.”

See: Background Information

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4
* **Associated Articles:** Background Information (ID: 33415)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#2) (id: 274138)

**"Now, before the face of this"**

In this book, the expression **face** often refers to the front of a person, place, or object. Here the expression has the further figurative significance of “in front of” or “before” a certain time. Alternate translation: “before this time”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#3) (id: 274139)

**"Eliashib"**

This is a man’s name. See how you translated it in [3:1](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1).

See: How to Translate Names

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#4) (id: 274140)

**"Eliashib the priest"**

Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who Eliashib was. As we learn in [3:1](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1), [3:20](https://ref.ly/Neh3:20), and [12:10](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10), he was actually the Jewish high priest during the time of Nehemiah. Alternate translation: “the high priest”

* **Associated Articles:** Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding (ID: 33264)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#5) (id: 274141)

**"Eliashib the priest,"** \- **"was being put"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in active form. Alternate translation: “they appointed Eliashib the priest” or “the leaders appointed Eliashib the priest”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: 33258)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#6) (id: 274142)

**"was being put in the chamber of the house of our God"**

This is most likely a figurative way of saying that as high priest, Eliashib had responsibility for and control over all the rooms in the temple. Alternate translation: “since he had control over”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#7) (id: 274143)

**"nearly\-related to Tobiah"**

Since Tobiah was an Ammonite, Eliashib could not have been his close blood relative. So this expression must refer to a connection by marriage. We learn in [6:18](https://ref.ly/Neh6:18) that both Tobiah and his son had married Jewish women, and one or both of these women may have been relatives of Eliashib. Alternate translation: “who was related to Tobiah by marriage”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:4

## Nehemiah 13:4 (#8) (id: 274144)

**"in the chamber of the house of our God"**

Here one **chamber** or room is used to mean “every chamber” or room in the temple. Alternate translation: “every room in the temple”

**"the house of our God"**

As often in this book, Nehemiah speaks of the temple here as the **house of God**, as if it were God’s dwelling place. Alternate translation: “the temple”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#1) (id: 274146)

**"And he made"**

In this context, the conjunction **and** indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the reason for what the previous sentence described, or what made it possible. Alternate translation: “and so” unless you used the word “since” to introduce the last phrase in [13:4](https://ref.ly/Neh13:4), in which case the connection would already be clear and you would not need to use any connecting phrase here.

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#2) (id: 274147)

**"for him"**

Verse [13:7](https://ref.ly/Neh13:7) indicates that **him** refers to Tobiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “he allowed Tobiah to move into a large room in the temple”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:5

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#3) (id: 274148)

**"and there previously they were putting offerings"**

**They** means the Israelites, and **offerings**, if it is a general term (See: next note), means the contributions that they gave to support the priests and Levites, as described in [12:44](https://ref.ly/Neh12:44). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “This was the room that the Israelites had previously been using to store the offerings they brought to the temple to support the priests and Levites”

**"offerings"**

The word **offerings** could be referring generally to all of the contributions that the Israelites brought, which would then be listed in the rest of this verse, or it could be the first specific item on the list, the daily grain offering, as described in [10:33](https://ref.ly/Neh10:33). Alternate translation: “the offerings they brought” or “the daily grain offering”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:5

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#5) (id: 274150)

**"the frankincense"**

This means the portion, one tenth, of their crops and produce that the Israelites had promised to contribute to support the temple personnel, as described in [10:37–38](https://ref.ly/Neh10:37-Neh10:38). Alternate translation: “the tenth of their crops and produce”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:5

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#8) (id: 274153)

**"and the tithes of"**

A **tithe** means a tenth (1/10\) or one part out of ten equal parts.

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#9) (id: 274154)

**"the commandment for the Levites, and the ones who sang, and the gatekeepers"**

Here Nehemiah leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. This phrase means “which the law had commanded them to contribute to support the Levites, the singers, and the temple gatekeepers.” You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers.

## Nehemiah 13:5 (#10) (id: 274155)

**"and the offerings of the priests"**

Here, **offerings of the priests** refers to offerings that people brought for the priests, not offerings made by the priests. This may have included the tithe, or one tenth of what they received, that the Levites contributed to the priests, as described in [10:38](https://ref.ly/Neh10:38). Alternate translation: “and the contributions to support the priests”

**"And during all this"**

This expression indicates that the sentence it introduces describes something that was happening at the same time as the events the book has just described. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase such as “while all of this was happening” to indicate this.

## Nehemiah 13:6 (#2) (id: 274157)

**"For"**

This word indicates that the clause it introduces explains the reason for what the previous clause described. That is, Nehemiah is about to give the reason why he was not in Jerusalem while Eliashib was allowing Tobiah to move into the temple. Alternate translation: “because”

## Nehemiah 13:6 (#3) (id: 274158)

**"I had gone to the king in year 32 of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon"**

Here Nehemiah is providing background information to explain why he was not in Jerusalem. As he indicates in [5:14](https://ref.ly/Neh5:14), he was governor of Judah for twelve years, from the twentieth to the thirty\-second year of the reign of King Artaxerxes. As this verse indicates, he then returned to the royal court. Alternate translation: “I had returned to serve King Artaxerxes in his court in the thirty\-second year of his reign”

## Nehemiah 13:6 (#5) (id: 274160)

**"the king of Babylon"**

Artaxerxes was the king of the Persian Empire, but since the Persians had conquered the Babylonians, he also had the right to use the title “king of Babylon.” The fact that Nehemiah describes him by this title may actually indicate that the royal court was located in the city of Babylon at this time and that he returned to that city to resume his duties in the court. Alternate translation: “the king of Persia, whose court was then in Babylon”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Nehemiah 13:6 (#7) (id: 274162)

**"I requested leave from the king"**

The implication, as shown explicitly in the next verse, is that Nehemiah requested time off from his responsibilities in the court so that he could travel back to Judah and see how the people there were doing, and that the king gave him permission to do this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I asked the king if I could take some time off and travel back to Judah to help the people there, and he gave me permission to do that”

## Nehemiah 13:7 (#4) (id: 274166)

**"about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God"**

While in the book of Nehemiah the word **evil** often means things like “sad” or “harmful,” in this context, the word does describe something that is morally bad and destructive. Eliashib had not done this wrong thing to Tobiah, but on his behalf. Alternate translation: “about the wrong thing that Eliashib had done by allowing Tobiah to move into a storeroom within the temple courts”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:7

## Nehemiah 13:7 (#5) (id: 274167)

## Nehemiah 13:8 (#1) (id: 274168)

**"And it was extremely evil to me"**

This expression describes Nehemiah’s perspective on the action. It does not mean that Eliashib did a wrong thing to Nehemiah directly. Alternate translation: “I recognized how very wrong this was”

## Nehemiah 13:8 (#2) (id: 274169)

**"and I cast out all the things of the house of Tobiah from the storeroom to the outside"**

Here, the term **house** represents all the possessions of Tobiah. It does not mean a literal house that Tobiah owned, because the context shows that he was staying in a room within the temple. Rather, **house** is a metaphor for “property,” that is, the things a person owns and would keep in a house. Alternate translation: “I threw everything that Tobiah was keeping in that storeroom right out of the temple”

## Nehemiah 13:9 (#2) (id: 274171)

**"And I spoke, and they purified the chambers"**

The implication is that Nehemiah spoke to the priests since they would have been the ones to conduct a ceremony like the one the story describes in [12:30](https://ref.ly/Neh12:30) to show that the people wanted the rooms in the temple to be ceremonially clean in the hopes that they would once more be acceptable to God.

As in [3:1](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1) and [12:47](https://ref.ly/Neh12:47), **consecrate** means to set something apart for a special purpose. Nehemiah was telling the Levites that they should guard the gates in order to prevent people from bringing goods for sale into the city on the Sabbath day. That way, they would ensure that the Sabbath continued to be a day that was set apart for the special purpose of rest and worship, and it would not be treated like an ordinary day.

## Nehemiah 13:24 (#2) (id: 274262)

**"And their sons, half were speaking Ashdodite, and none of them were knowing to speak Hebrew"**

This could mean one of two things. It seems most likely that the expression means that: (1\) these children spoke a mixed language, using Ashdodite expressions half the time and Hebrew expressions the other half of the time, so that none of them knew how to speak Hebrew fluently. The expression could also mean that (2\) half of the children who were born to Hebrew fathers and foreign mothers spoke a foreign language. However, if half spoke Ashdodite, and none spoke Hebrew, this leaves open the question of what language the other half of the children spoke. Alternate translation: (1\) “their children spoke a mixed dialect, using Philistine expressions half the time, so that none of them could speak Hebrew fluently” or (2\) “half of their children spoke the language of the Philistines, and none of their children knew how to speak Hebrew”

Here Nehemiah is reporting the words of the oath in the second person, because this is his account of how he spoke to the men who had married foreign women. When these men said the actual oath, they would have used the first person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person in your translation as well.

**"And I caused them to swear an oath by God: “If you give your daughters to their sons, or if you lift from their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves"**

Nehemiah has the men take an oath using a common Hebrew formula that leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Whenever a person takes an oath using this formula, the implication is, “May God punish me severely if I do this thing.” Alternate translation: “If we allow our daughters to marry their sons, or if we or our sons marry their daughters, may God punish us severely!”

## Nehemiah 13:28 (#8) (id: 274293)

**"And I caused him to flee from beside me"**

**Him** means this son of Joiada. Nehemiah means not just that he made this man leave his personal presence, but that he forced him to at least leave Jerusalem, and perhaps to stay out of the entire province of Judah. Nehemiah is using the space around himself to represent all Jerusalem and Judah. Alternate translation: “I forced him to leave Jerusalem” or “I forced him to leave the province of Judah”

## Nehemiah 13:28 (#9) (id: 274294)

**"And I caused him to flee from beside me"**

The implication is that this son of Joiada was serving as a priest himself (as his lineage entitled him to do), and so he was a high\-profile case of flaunting the command in the law against marrying foreign women. Nehemiah needed to make an example of him. A further consideration may have been that Sanballat was an enemy to Nehemiah and the Jews, and this man was one of the people who was sending letters to Sanballat with information about Nehemiah, as 6:17 indicates. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express one of these possibilites explicitly. Alternate translation: “I forced him to leave Jerusalem because as a priest, he was setting a bad public example by being married to a foreign woman” or “I forced him to leave Jerusalem because he was helping our enemy Sanballat”

**"Remember them, my God, on account of the defiling of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites"**

As in [13:22](https://ref.ly/Neh13:22), Nehemiah stops addressing the audience of his story and speaks directly to God. You could indicate this by putting this verse in quotation marks. Review the note at [4:4](https://ref.ly/Neh4:4) about asides like this if that would be helpful.

## Nehemiah 13:29 (#2) (id: 274296)

**"Remember them"**

**Them** likely means this son of Joiada, who had married a foreign woman, and Joiada himself, who had arranged with Sanballat for his son to marry Sanballat’s daughter. As often in this book, **remember** means to think about someone and consider what action you should take in their regard. Nehemiah is not suggesting that God has forgotten about Joiada and his son. Alternate translation: “treat Joiada and his son the way they deserve for what they have done”

**"on account of the defiling of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites"**

Alternate translation: “they have dishonored the priesthood and broken the covenant you made with the priests and Levites”

## Nehemiah 13:30 (#2) (id: 274300)

**"And I purified them from everything foreign"**

**Them** means the priests and Levites whom Nehemiah has just mentioned. He probably says **purified** in a figurative sense. He did not hold a ceremony of purification, since the priests and Levites themselves would have done that. Rather, he means that he made sure that none of the other priests or Levites were married to foreign women, and that in this way he ensured that the priesthood was no longer unclean, as described in [13:29](https://ref.ly/Neh13:29). Alternate translation: “I made sure that none of the priests or Levites were married to foreign women.”

## Nehemiah 13:30 (#3) (id: 274301)

**"And I caused the service watches to stand: for the priests and for the Levites"**

Generally in this book, the phrase **service watch** refers to the Levite singers. It means either an individual choir or a time on duty for the singers. But since Nehemiah also speaks of the priests here, in this context the phrase seems to mean more generally the time on duty for both the priests and the Levites. Alternate translation: “I made sure that the priests and Levites all came on duty in the temple when they were supposed to”

* **Associated Passages:** NEH 13:30

## Nehemiah 13:30 (#4) (id: 274302)

**"And I caused"** \- **"to stand"**

Nehemiah is speaking of these temple arrangements figuratively, as in [5:13](https://ref.ly/Neh5:13), as if they were a living thing that could stand, that is, stay in place or be established rather than go away. Alternate translation: “I made sure that”

## Nehemiah 13:31 (#1) (id: 274304)

**"and for the offering of pieces of wood at the appointed times; and for the firstfruits"**

This verse continues the sentence that begins in the previous verse, so here Nehemiah is describing two further things that he **caused to stand** or made sure happened. He is referring to the promises that the people made in their covenant to bring these contributions to the temple to support the priests and Levites. See how you translated these terms in [10:34](https://ref.ly/Neh10:34) and [10:35](https://ref.ly/Neh10:35). Alternate translation: “I also made sure that the people brought their offerings of wood and of the first crops that grow in their fields at the times when they had promised to bring them”

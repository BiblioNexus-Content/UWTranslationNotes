## 1 Thessalonians 1:1 (#4) (id: 245968)

**"in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"**

Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ** to describe the union of believers with **God** and **Christ**. In this case, being **in God** and **Christ**, or united to God and Christ, identifies the Thessalonians as Christians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that the Thessalonians have a very close relationship with **God** and **Christ**. Alternative translation: “that is united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ”

## 1 Thessalonians 1:1 (#9) (id: 245973)

Other ancient manuscripts read “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

**"our God and Father himself"**

For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun “he,” which is already implied in the the phrase **our God and Father**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **himself**. Alternate translation: “he who is our God and Father” or “God our Father indeed”

**"just as the birth pain to the one having in the womb, and they will certainly not escape"**

Paul is saying that **sudden destruction** during the day of the Lord is like **birth pain** because both events begin suddenly and cannot be avoided.

**"they will certainly not escape"**

The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “they will by no means escape”

Other ancient manuscripts read “as a thief.” This reading would mean that the **day** overtakes some people **as a thief** overtakes people and steals from them.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:23 (#8) (id: 246471)

**"your whole spirit, and soul, and body"**

Here Paul uses the three terms **spirit**, **soul**, and **body** together to refer to the whole person. These three terms could: (1\) describe different aspects of the whole person from different perspectives. In this case, the three terms do not define three separate pieces that together make up a person. You could use fewer or more terms to refer to different aspects of the person. Alternate translation: “your whole body and soul” or “your whole life, mind, feelings, and desires” (2\) describe three separate pieces that together make up a person. In this case, you should use two terms to refer to two different non\-physical parts (**spirit** and **soul**) and one term to refer to one physical part (**body**). Alternate translation: “your whole mind, and life, and flesh”

## 1 Thessalonians 5:26 (#1) (id: 246479)

**"with a holy kiss"**

A **holy kiss** was a symbolic action to show familial love between believers. In some cultures, a kiss as a greeting is appropriate, but in other cultures it is not appropriate. The idea of a **holy kiss** is that it be a greeting that is appropriate in the culture, whether it be a kiss, a hug, a handshake, or something else, and also that it be holy, that is, appropriate between God’s people. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “warmly, as fellow believers”

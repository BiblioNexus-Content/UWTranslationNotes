## 1 Timothy 1:1 (#1) (id: 246488)

**"Paul, an apostle"**

In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul. I am an apostle”

## 1 Timothy 1:1 (#2) (id: 246489)

**"according to the command of God our Savior and of the Lord Jesus Christ"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **command**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as it was commanded by God our Savior and by the Lord Jesus Christ”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: 33257)

## 1 Timothy 1:1 (#3) (id: 246490)

**"our Savior"**

Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **Savior** who saves us. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who saves us”

See: Possession

* **Associated Articles:** Possession (ID: 33303)

## 1 Timothy 1:1 (#4) (id: 246491)

**"our"** \- **"our"**

In this letter, Paul uses the words **our**, “we,” and “us” to refer either to Timothy and himself or else to all believers, which would also include the two of them. So, use the inclusive forms of those words throughout your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’

* **Associated Articles:** Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ (ID: 33271)

## 1 Timothy 1:1 (#5) (id: 246492)

**"of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope"**

Here, **our hope** refers to the person in whom we have hope. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translations: “of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one in whom we have hope”

## 1 Timothy 1:2 (#1) (id: 246494)

**"to Timothy"**

In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here, starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “This letter is for you, Timothy”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** 1TI 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: 33256)

## 1 Timothy 1:2 (#2) (id: 246495)

**"a genuine child"**

Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Timothy were his **genuine child**. Paul means that he is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves Timothy in the way a father loves his **child**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is like a genuine child to me” or “truly my spiritual son”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## 1 Timothy 1:2 (#3) (id: 246496)

**"genuine"**

Here, the word **genuine** indicates that the **child** is considered to be someone’s child in the full legal sense. For example, a chlid born to an unmarried woman would not be considered **genuine**. In the context of the metaphor, the word indicates that Timothy has acted as a son should act toward Paul. If your readers would not be familiar with the concept of a **genuine child**, you could use the name of a similar concept in your culture or you could use a more general phrase. Alternate translation: “legitimate” or “true”

**"Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord"**

Here Paul could be implying that, when he previously **urged** Timothy to remain in Ephesus, he was: (1\) in Ephesus with Timothy and was about to leave for **Macedonia**.

## 1 Timothy 1:3 (#3) (id: 246504)

## 1 Timothy 1:3 (#4) (id: 246505)

**"to teach differently"**

The implication is that these people were teaching different things than what Paul and Timothy taught, not that they were teaching in a different way.

* **Associated Passages:** 1TI 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## 1 Timothy 1:3–4 (#1) (id: 246501)

**"Just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently"** \- **"and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, {which is} by faith"**

Here Paul begins a comparison using the phrase **Just as**, but he does not complete the comparison. However, he implies that **Just as** he **urged** Timothy to do these things at an earlier time, now he urges Timothy to continue to do these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implied part of the comparison explicit. You could include it at the beginning of the sentence, at the end of the sentence, or somewhere else. Alternate translation: “I urge you now, just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you earlier, to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith.” or “Just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently, and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith, so now I urge you again to do those things.”

**"myths"**

The word **myths** refers to a certain kind of story that is generally considered to be untrustworthy. This kind of story is often about what important people did a long time ago. Often, many people in a culture know these stories but do not consider them to be reliable historical narratives.

**"knowing this"**

Here, the phrase **knowing this** introduces a reason why Paul and other believers know that “the law if good” (see [1:8](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:8)).

**"father\-killers and mother\-killers, man\-slayers"**

In this list Paul uses several compound words to express his meaning concisely and vividly.

In this case, **childbearing** describes one means by which God accomplishes salvation. Alternate translation: “she will be saved through how the Messiah came by means of women bearing children” (2\) **she** (women in general) **will be saved** spiritually as they have children and act as mothers.

He could be implying that these widows **want to marry**: (1\) anyone who has money and can support their self\-indulgent lifestyles, even if that person is an unbeliever. Alternate translation: “they want to marry anyone who can support their self\-indulgent desires” or “they want to marry even unbelievers so they can live as they desire” (2\) after they have promised to serve in the church as widows without marrying again.

In Paul’s culture, farmers often would make oxen thresh, that is, walk on harvested wheat to separate the kernels of grain from the wheat stalks. Some people would **muzzle an ox** while it was **threshing** in order to keep the ox from eating the grain.

Here Paul does not specify what **the commandment** is. He could be referring to the instructions he just wrote, to the instructions in the letter as a whole, to what Timothy is supposed to do as a leader, or to what all believers are supposed to do. If possible, use a general phrase that could refer to any of these specific commands. If you need to be more specific, you could indicate that either God or Paul gave this **commandment**. Alternate translation: “the commandment that you know”

Here Paul means that God is **the only One** who always has and always will exist. He will never die or cease to exist. While Christians believe that those who trust in Jesus will live forever, God is the one who enables them to do that.

**"storing up for themselves a good foundation for what is coming"**

Here Paul speaks of doing the good works that he has just listed as if that were to be **storing up** treasure. He means that good things done in this life will ensure good things for life after Jesus comes back. Paul also speaks as if doing those good works would construct **a good foundation**. He means that people who do those good works will be certain to experience good things from the moment when Jesus comes back. If it is possible, you could preserve both these metaphors. Otherwise, you could: (1\) only use the treasure metaphor. Alternate translation: “storing up for themselves good treasure for what is coming” or “ensuring that they will have good things in what is coming as if they were storing up treasure for themselves” (2\) only use the foundation metaphor.

## Judges - Introduction (id: 776855)

Introduction to Judges
======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of Judges

A. Introduction: the tribes conquer their territories (1:1–3:6\) B. History of the judges of Israel (3:7–16:31\) Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar (3:7–31\) Deborah and Barak (4:1–5:31\) Gideon (6:1–8:35\) Abimelek (9:1–57\) Tola and Jair (10:1–5\) Jephthah (10:6–12:7\) Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15\) Samson (13:1–16:31\) C. Dan becomes a center of idolatry (17:1–18:31\) D. Outrage at Gibeah, civil war against Benjamin (19:1–21:25\)

### What is the book of Judges about?

The book of Judges tells of events that occurred after the Israelites settled in the land of Canaan. The events in this book happened over a period of about 150 years. The book continues the biblical narrative directly from the book of Joshua. It begins, “After the death of Joshua,” resuming the story at the point it had reached at the end of the book of Joshua.

This book describes how the Israelites repeatedly sinned against Yahweh during this time. They worshiped false gods and did the same wicked things as the peoples who lived around them. Therefore, God would allow enemies to defeat and oppress the Israelites. Eventually, the Israelites would call to Yahweh for help. Yahweh would then cause someone to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. This person was called a “judge.” The Israelites would live in peace until the judge died. After that judge died, the Israelites would start sinning again. So this pattern of events would repeat.

### What title should translators give this book?

This book has traditionally had the title “Judges” because it gives accounts of some of the main leaders or judges in Israel before there were any kings ruling the people. Unless a translation of the Bible exists in your region that uses a different title, you should probably use the title “Judges” or a similar title such as “The Book about the Leaders in Israel.”

Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book
----------------------------------------------------

### What kind of leaders were the judges?

The judges were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. Afterward these leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of these leaders may have served only certain tribes.

### What kind of society was Israel during the time of the judges?

During this time, the twelve tribes of Israel were independent of one another. They were not a unified nation with one ruler. However, they were descendants of the same ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They also shared in the same covenant with Yahweh. So the tribes would often help each other when enemies were threatening them. However, the book of Judges tells of some times when the tribes fought against each other.

Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book
---------------------------------------

### “the angel of Yahweh”

In many places in the book, the author speaks of a character whom he calls “the angel of Yahweh.” Interpreters are unsure about the exact identity of this character. When he speaks, sometimes the author says “the angel said” and sometimes the author says “Yahweh said.” So he is closely identified with Yahweh in some way, although it is not clear in precisely what way. We recommend that you translate this phrase using the same words that you use in the rest of your translation for “angel” and “Yahweh.” The UST models one way to do this.

### “arose”

In many contexts, the author uses the expression “arose” to mean that a person took action or took on a particular role. It does not mean that he or she stood up from a sitting or lying position. Similarly, characters sometimes tell other characters to “arise,” meaning that they should take action. Notes will help clarify what the expression means in specific contexts. (See: Idiom)

### “behold”

The author and characters often use the word “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they are about to say. While the word literally means “look,” the speakers do not want their listeners to look at something, but to pay careful attention. (See: Metaphor)

### “in the eyes of”

The author and characters often use the term “eyes” by association to mean sight; sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and estimation or judgment. For example, the author says in 2:11 that the Israelites “did evil in the eyes of Yahweh,” meaning that they did what Yahweh considered wrong and had said was wrong. Samson says to his parents in 14:3 about the woman he wants to marry, “she is right in my eyes,” meaning that he thinks she is the right one for him. (See: Metonymy)

### “to the face of”

The author and characters often use the word “face” to represent the presence of a person or group, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The expression “to the face of” can have different shades of meaning, depending on the context. The focus may be more on the presence of a person, such as in 20:26, where the author says that the Israelites “sat … to the face of Yahweh.” He means that they were in the presence of Yahweh near his sacred tent. The focus may also be on something being in front of or near a person or thing. When the author says in 3:27 that Ehud was “to the face of” the Israelite soldiers who were with him, he means that Ehud was in front of them, that is, leading their army. Or the focus may be on the relationship between people or groups, as in 11:33, where the author says that “the sons of Ammon were subdued from the face of the sons of Israel.” This means that the Ammonites were subdued in relation to the Israelites, that is, they became subject to them. (See: Metonymy)

In other contexts, the author or a character may use the word “face,” describing part of a person, in order to represent the whole person as being present. For example, in 13:15, when Manoah tells the angel of Yahweh, “we will prepare to your face a kid of goats,” he means that he wants him to remain present so that they can prepare the goat and serve it to him. (See: Synecdoche)

### “into the hand of,” “into your hand”

The author and characters often use the word “hand” by association to represent the power and capability of a person. For example, the author says in 11:32 that when Jephthah went to fight the Ammonites, “Yahweh gave them into his hand.” This means that Yahweh gave him the power to defeat them. The word “hand” may also represent possession, as when the author says in 7:8 that Gideon’s soldiers “took provision into their hand.” The word “hand” may also represent agency, as when the author speaks in 3:4 of the commandments that Yahweh gave the Israelites “by the hand of Moses.” In such cases, the author is using the hand, part of a person, to mean the whole person in the act of doing something. Notes will help distinguish the difference between these shades of meaning when that may not be clear from the context. (See: Metonymy and Synecdoche)

### “hear,” “listen”

The author and characters often use the terms “hear” and “listen” to mean complying with what someone has said. When humans “hear” or “listen” in this sense, the terms mean “obey,” as when the author says negatively in 2:17 that the disobedient Israelites did not “hear the commandments of Yahweh.” When Yahweh “hears” or “listens” in this sense, it means that he does what someone asks in prayer. For example, when the author says in 13:9 that “God listened to the voice of Manoah,” he means that God answered Manoah’s prayer and sent the angel back to him and his wife. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

### name of tribe, city, or kingdom representing its people

The author and characters often use the name of a tribe, city, or kingdom to represent its people. For example, in 1:12, when Caleb speaks of “whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher,” he is using the name of that city to refer by association to the people who live in it. (See: Metonymy)

### name of a person representing associated or accompanying people

For example, in 3:10, when the author says of Othniel that “he went out to war,” he is using Othniel, one person who was involved in this action, to represent everyone who was involved. He means that the army of Israel went out to war with Othniel commanding it. (See: Synecdoche)

### “nose burned against”

In several places in the book, the author uses the term “nose” and the expression “burned” to mean anger. For example, in 2:14 he says that “the nose of Yahweh burned against Israel,” meaning that Yahweh became very angry with the Israelites. This is by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose and the way the skin of a person who is angry becomes hotter. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part and disposition of the body. If so, it may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.” (See: Idiom)

### “shall”

The ULT represents the Hebrew instructional verb form with the English helping verb “shall.” For example, when Deborah tells Barak in Judges 4:6 “and you shall take with you 10,000 men,” she is instructing him to take 10,000 men with him. Other ways to say this are: “you are to take 10,000 men with you” or “take 10,000 men with you.” Translate this form with the most natural way in your language for giving instructions. (See: Irregular Use of Tenses)

### “sons of”

The author and characters often speak of “the sons of” a person to mean the nation or tribe that consists of his descendants. For example, the author speaks in 1:1 of the “sons of Israel” to mean the Israelites and in 1:8 of the “sons of Judah” to mean the people of the tribe of Judah and particularly their army. In this case, “sons” does not mean first\-generation offspring but later descendants. (See: Metaphor)

The phrase “sons of” may also refer to people who have a particular characteristic or quality. For example, the author speaks in 18:2 of “sons of valor,” meaning men who were characterized by valor, that is, valiant warriors. (See: Idiom)

### “struck,” “struck to the mouth of the sword”

In many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, or king, as if they had only hit them. But he means that they attacked those opponents, and in some contexts the meaning is clearly that they killed them. That is the case in 3:29, for example, where the author says, “And they struck Moab at that time, about 10,000 men … not one escaped.” (See: Metonymy)

In several contexts the author uses a longer form of this expression and says “they struck them (or it) to the mouth of the sword.” This means that they completely destroyed a city, killing everyone who lived there. For example, speaking in 1:25 of what the tribes descended from Joseph did to Bethel, the author says that “they struck the city with the mouth of the sword.” (See: Idiom)

### “went up,” “went down”

In Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. For example, in 1:3 the soldiers of Judah ask the soldiers of Simeon to “go up” with them into their allotment because the Israelites were in the valley of the Jordan River and the Judeans’ allotment was in the hills above the valley. In 3:27, the author says that the fighting men of Ephraim “went down” with Ehud because they were going from the hill country of Ephraim down into the Jordan River valley. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate instances such as these simply as “go” or “went.”

Judges 1 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* Verses 1–10: Judah conquers its assigned territory
* Verses 11–16: Caleb and Othniel conquer Debir (Kiriath Sepher)
* Verses 12–21: Judah and Simeon conquer territory but leave some hostile nations

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Cutting off the thumbs and big toes of captured enemies

In [1:7](https://ref.ly/Judg1:7), Adoni\-Bezek describes how he had his soldiers cut off the thumbs and big toes of the kings he had defeated. This prevented a captured enemy from running away or from ever using a weapon again. However, as the context shows, it was also a way of humiliating a captured king. When the Israelites did this to Adoni\-Bezek, he acknowledged that he was getting what he deserved for having done this to others.

### Complete destruction of a city and its people

In [1:17](https://ref.ly/Judg1:17), the armies of Judah and Simeon completely destroy a Canaanite city and kill all of its people. They call the place “Hormah,” which means “destruction.” [Deuteronomy 7:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:4) describes how, when Yahweh was preparing the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commanded them to destroy completely the Canaanite people who lived there. They were not to make any treaties with them or to intermarry with them. This was to prevent the Israelites from joining them in worshiping their false gods, which would have led them to develop a culture and society very different from the kind that Yahweh wanted. The book of Joshua describes how the Israelites completely destroyed the major Canaanite cities and their people. In this chapter, [1:17](https://ref.ly/Judg1:17) describes a further instance of that. However, the Israelites left many of the Canaanite people in the land, and they did intermarry with them and worship their gods. This led the Israelites into many evil practices that made Yahweh very angry with them.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Names of people groups, cities, and Israelite tribes meaning their people or armies

In this chapter, the author and characters frequently use the names of people groups or cities by association to mean the people or armies of those groups or cities. For example, when the author says in [1:1](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1) that the Israelites “fought against Jerusalem,” he means that they fought against the people who lived in that city. The author and characters sometimes also speak of the Israelite tribes as if they were individual people who could talk to one another, go places together, and so forth. For example, the author says in [1:1](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1), “Then Judah said to Simeon, his brother, ‘Go up with me into my allotment.’” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. For example, instead of saying “Judah,” you could say “the people of the tribe of Judah.” (See: Metonymy and Personification)

### Generic nouns

In this chapter, the author and characters use expressions such as “the Canaanite,” “the Perizzite,” “the Amorite,” and so forth. They are not referring to specific individuals. Rather, they mean in general the people of the nation mentioned. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms, for example, “the Canaanites.” (See: Generic Noun Phrases)

## Judges 1:1 (#1) (id: 776857)

**"And it happened"**

The author is using the phrase **And it happened** to introduce a new event in the story of the people of Israel, which continues here in the book of Judges at the point where it left off at the end of the book of Joshua. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:1 (#3) (id: 776859)

**"Who will go up"**

The Israelites are asking Yahweh which of their tribes should be the first to go into its allotment and fight against the Canaanites living there. They are speaking of that tribe as if it were an individual person. (The verb in this phrase is singular, indicating that **Who** is also singular.) See the discussion of this issue, which occurs several times in this chapter, in the Introduction to this chapter. Alternate translation: \[What tribe will go up]

* **Associated Articles:** Personification (ID: `33302@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:1 (#4) (id: 776860)

**"for us"**

By **us**, the Israelites mean themselves but not Yahweh, to whom they are speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ (ID: `33271@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:1 (#5) (id: 776861)

**"the Canaanite"** \- **"against him"**

As the Introduction to this chapter discuss, here and in similar instances throughout the chapter, this is not a reference to a specific **Canaanite**. Rather, it refers to the Canaanites or the Canaanite nations in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: \[the Canaanites … against them] or \[the Canaanite nations … against them]

## Judges 1:2 (#1) (id: 776862)

**"Judah"**

As the Introduction to Judges and the Introduction to this chapter discuss, here Yahweh is using the name **Judah** by association to mean the army that belongs to the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: \[The army of the tribe of Judah]

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:2 (#2) (id: 776863)

**"Behold"**

Yahweh is using the term **Behold**, which literally means “Look,” to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. See the discussion of this usage in the Introduction to Judges. In this context, since Yahweh is the speaker, there is also the implication that what follows is something that Yahweh has determined and so is certain to happen. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: \[Indeed]

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:2 (#3) (id: 776864)

**"I have given the land into his hand"**

Here, as the Introduction to Judges discusses, having something in one’s **hand** represents possessing it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[I have given them possession of the land]

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:3 (#1) (id: 776865)

**"Then Judah said to Simeon"** \- **"So Simeon went with him"**

As the Introduction to this chapter discuss, here the author is speaking of the tribes of Judah and Simeon as if they were individual people who could speak with each other. Alternate translation: \[Then the people of Judah said to the people of Simeon … So the people of Simeon went with them] or \[Then the commanders of the Judean army said to the commanders of the Simeonite army … So the Simeonite army went with the Judean army]

## Judges 1:4 (#1) (id: 776870)

**"And Judah went up"**

As the Introduction to this chapter discuss, here the author is using the name of one of the tribes whose soldiers were in this army to mean the entire army, which included soldiers from both tribes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[And the army of the tribe of Judah went up with the army of the tribe of Simeon]

## Judges 1:4 (#2) (id: 776871)

**"and Yahweh gave the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand"**

Here, as the Introduction to Judges discusses, **hand** represents the power or capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[and Yahweh gave them the power to conquer the Canaanites and the Perizzites]

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:4 (#3) (id: 776872)

**"And at Bezek they struck"**

As the Introduction to Judges discusses, when the author says that the armies of Judah and Simeon **struck** or “hit” the Canaanite and Perizzite soldiers who opposed them, he means that they defeated them and, in contexts such as this, that they killed them. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: \[And at Bezek they defeated] or \[And at Bezek they killed]

## Judges 1:5 (#2) (id: 776876)

**"Adoni\-Bezek"**

The word **Adoni\-Bezek** is the name or title of a man. It means “the lord of Bezek,” and so it may be the title for the king who reigned in the city of Bezek.

## Judges 1:5 (#3) (id: 776877)

**"and they fought against him"**

As the Notes to this chapter discuss, here the author is using Adoni\-Bezek to represent both this king himself and his entire army. Alternate translation: \[and they fought against him and his army]

## Judges 1:6 (#1) (id: 776878)

**"the thumbs of his hands and his feet"**

Some languages use the same word for the largest finger and the largest toe, as the biblical text does here. If your language has different words for these, you can use both words in your translation. If the phrase might then seem to contain extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language, you could shorten it, as the UST does. Alternate translation: \[the thumbs of his hands and the big toes of his feet]

## Judges 1:7 (#1) (id: 776879)

**"70 kings"**

* **Associated Articles:** Numbers (ID: `33392@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 1:7 (#2) (id: 776880)

**"kings"**

In Canaan at this time, each city and town had a ruler who had the same title as someone who ruled over a large territory. So, for example, Pharaoh is called the “the king of Egypt” in Exodus 1:5, while the book of Joshua refers to the “king” of cities such as Libnah (Joshua 10:30\) and Hebron (Joshua 10:37\). If your language uses a different word for people who rule over one community than for people who rule over extensive areas, you could use that term here. Alternate translation: \[chieftains]

## Judges 1:7 (#3) (id: 776881)

**"with} the thumbs of their hands and their feet cut off"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See the Notes to this chapter for an explanation of the practice described here. It is unlikely that Adoni\-Bezek was the agent who did this personally. Alternate translation: \[whose thumbs and big toes I ordered my soldiers to cut off]

## Judges 1:7 (#4) (id: 776882)

**"were gathering beneath my table"**

Adoni\-Bezek is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: \[were gathering scraps of food beneath my table]

## Judges 1:7 (#5) (id: 776883)

**"were gathering beneath my table"**

Dozens of **kings** would not have fit under the **table** where Adoni\-Bezek ate his meals, so he probably does not mean this literally. Instead, he seems to be speaking of these defeated chieftains as if they were dogs that had to scrounge for food from the scraps that fell from his table. This indicates that he had reduced them to a state of helpless dependence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[had to survive on what little I gave them] or \[were my helpless prisoners]

Here, **sons** means “descendants.” The author is describing the people of the tribe of Judah as descendants of their ancestor Judah. In context, the reference is specifically to the army of the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: \[the Judeans] or \[the Judean army]

**"And they struck it to the mouth of the sword"**

As the Introduction to Judges discusses, the author is using the expression **to the mouth of the sword** to mean that the army of the tribe of Judah killed all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The UST models one way to do that.

**"Now the name of Hebron previously {was} Kiriath Arba"**

But at the time when Israel attacked it, it was called **Kiriath Arba**. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. You may also wish to mark it in some way as background information, such as by putting it in parentheses as the ULT does. Alternate translation: \[Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba]

**"in the coming of her"**

The author assumes that his readers will understand what he means by this phrase. This could mean: (1\) that Aksah came to Kiriath Sepher in order to marry Othniel and that she made this **request** when she arrived and saw the land that Caleb had given to him. Alternate translation: \[when Aksah arrived at Kiriath Sepher] (2\) that the author is using this expression to describe Aksah entering Othniel’s household as his wife. Alternate translation: \[once Aksah had married Othniel]

## Judges 1:14 (#3) (id: 776901)

**"that she persuaded him to request the field"**

The author is leaving implicit who was to make this request. The meaning does not seem to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that he should **request** this **field** from Caleb, since he is not the one who asks; she is. In this culture, a young man such as Othniel may not have had the standing to make this kind of request from a leader such as Caleb. So the meaning seems to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that she should ask for the field. In this culture, a daughter may have been able to make such a request of her father. Alternate translation: \[that she persuaded him to allow her to request the field]

## Judges 1:14 (#4) (id: 776902)

**"the field from her father"**

The author has a particular **field** in view. The narrative suggests that Caleb had given some land to Othniel but that it was arid territory. It suggests further that near this land, there was some ground that was suitable for cultivation because it was watered by springs. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[from her father some land that was nearby the land that he had already given to Othniel and that was watered by springs and so could be cultivated]

## Judges 1:15 (#2) (id: 776905)

**"a blessing"**

In this context, the word **blessing** is an abstract noun. It does not refer to something that someone would say to cause good and beneficial things to happen to a person. Instead, it refers to a good and beneficial thing itself. If your language does not use abstract nouns in this way, you could express the same idea in another way.

**"you shall also give to me"**

Aksah is using a verb form that could either indicate what a person ought to do or what a person is going to do. This could mean: (1\) that since the land Caleb gave Aksah and Othniel was dry, he also ought to give them some land with springs of water. Alternate translation: \[you should also give me] (2\) that Aksah is answering Caleb’s question and this is implicitly her request. Alternate translation: \[my request is that you will also give me]

The author is using this expression to introduce information about what was happening behind the scenes in this story and also to introduce an overall theme for [1:19–36](https://ref.ly/Judg1:19-Judg1:36). In a way that was not visible, Yahweh was helping the Israelites to defeat the Canaanites. Nevertheless, the Israelite tribes did not drive the Canaanite nations completely out of their assigned territories.

It is probably a reference to chariots whose wheels or floor were strengthened with iron or that had iron studs or points to make them more destructive when used in ramming.

## Judges - Chapter 2 Introduction (id: 776951)

Judges 2 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* Verses 1–5: The angel of Yahweh appears to the Israelites at Bokim
* Verses 6–10: Review: the Israelites worshiped and obeyed Yahweh during the lifetimes of Joshua and the elders
* Verses 11–23: The Israelites disobeyed Yahweh and worshiped other gods afterward, so Yahweh let other nations conquer them

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Joshua reappears in the story after it tells how he died

In Judges 2:6–9, the author repeats Joshua 24:28–31 to remind readers how the people of Israel served Yahweh faithfully when they first arrived in the land of Canaan. This is background information. After these verses, the main story of the book of Judges begins. It is about how the Israelites then worshiped other gods, but Yahweh repeatedly brought them back to himself and delivered them from their enemies when they repented. It may seem strange for the book to speak of Joshua doing something, since it begins “after the death of Joshua.” So you can translate this in a way that shows that the author is providing background information by describing something that happened in the past. See the note at 2:6 for a specific suggestion.

### “Cut a covenant”

The phrase “cut a covenant” occurs in this chapter. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” reflects the cultural background. It is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Metaphor

In this chapter, the author uses the word “fathers” several times to mean “ancestors.” He is not speaking of the immediate male parents of the Israelites, but of the generations who lived before them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (See: Metaphor)

### Symbolic action

In this chapter, the author speaks of the Israelites bowing down to idols that represented foreign gods. This was a symbolic action that constituted a public act of worship, so it represented a definitive expression of allegiance to those gods. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. When the book says that the Israelites bowed down to foreign gods, you could say, for example, that they “worshiped them by bowing down to them.” (See: figs\-symaction)

**"Bokim"**

The word **Bokim** is the name of a place. The Israelites actually give the place this name at the end of this episode, in [2:5](https://ref.ly/Judg2:5), but the author is using it here because his readers knew the place by that name. See the UST for one way to handle this issue.

## Judges 2:1 (#4) (id: 776955)

**"I am bringing you up"**

The angel, speaking on behalf of Yahweh, is using the present tense to describe a past event. He may be doing that because delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and settling them in the land of Canaan together constitute a single work on their behalf that was still ongoing at this point. However, if it would not be natural for a speaker of your language to use the present tense in such a context, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: \[I brought you up from Egypt]

## Judges 2:3 (#2) (id: 776963)

**"And I have also said"**

The angel, representing Yahweh, assumes that the Israelites will know when he **also said** this. In [Numbers 33:55](https://ref.ly/Num33:55), Yahweh told the Israelites that if they did not drive out the Canaanites, the ones who remained would be thorns in their sides. In [Joshua 23:12–13](https://ref.ly/Josh23:12-Josh23:13), Joshua warned the Israelites that if they made treaties with the Canaanite nations and intermarried with them, then Yahweh would no longer dispossess those nations and they would be thorns and a snare to the Israelites. So the angel seems to be indicating that Joshua was speaking on behalf of Yahweh when Joshua said that Yahweh would no longer drive out the Canaanites. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[And as I said through Joshua]

## Judges - Chapter 3 Introduction (id: 777024)

Judges 3 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

* Verses 1–8: The Israelites lived with other nations and worshiped their gods
* Verses 9–11: God sent Othniel to rescue Israel from Aram
* Verses 12–30: God sent Ehud to rescue Israel from Moab
* Verse 31: God sent Shamgar to rescue Israel from the Philistines

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Yahweh allowed other nations to conquer Israel

As [3:5–8](https://ref.ly/Judg3:5-Judg3:8) explains, Israel worshiped idols and false gods. Because of this, Yahweh allowed the nations of Aram and Moab to rule over them. In the period of Judges, when Israel sinned, they were often placed under the rule of a foreign power. However, when the people repented, Yahweh sent judges to deliver them. This chapter describes how Yahweh sent Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar to rescue Israel from foreign control. (See: False God and Sin)

### The carved images at Gilgal

Biblical scholars are not entirely sure what the “carved images” mentioned in [3:19](https://ref.ly/Judg3:19) were. They could have been some kind of boundary marker. Some interpreters associate them with the twelve large stones that Joshua set up at Gilgal in Joshua [4:20](https://ref.ly/Judg4:20). They seem to have been a recognizable landmark of some kind. Once Ehud and the porters reached them, Ehud knew that the porters were back in Israelite territory and could find their way safely back home from there without him. In your translation, you might refer to these as “carved stones” or, as in the UST, “boundary stones.”

**"Now those nations that Yahweh left for the testing of Israel by them, all who had not known any of the wars of Canaan"**

This is probably a reference to the way a sword cuts into a person as if it were an animal biting him.

## Judges 3:19 (#1) (id: 777065)

**"But he himself turned back"**

For emphasis, the author is stating the pronoun **he**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated as **turned**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **himself**. Alternate translation: \[But as for him, he turned back]

Now he was sitting in his upper room of coolness] (2\) that Ehud came into the **upper room** where Eglon was sitting. If so, this could mean that Ehud actually sent word to Eglon through his servants that he had a message for him, and Eglon summoned Ehud to come into his room where the two of them could speak privately once all the servants had left.

**"in the upper room of coolness that {was} to him"**

The phrase **upper room of coolness** describes a room in a palace that was designed to give rulers a place to go to escape the heat of summer, which was intense in this climate. Sometimes these were interior rooms on whose walls the sun did not shine, and sometimes they were rooms in a garden within the palace complex. In this case, it seems to have been a room on the roof that was exposed to currents of air, since the author describes it with the term **upper room**. Your language and culture may have an expression to describe such a room. Alternate translation: \[in his summer parlor] or \[in his cool roof chamber]

Your language may have a way of referring to this discreetly. Alternate translation: \[and he soiled himself] (2\) that the point of the sword came out the other side of Eglon’s body.

The author is providing background information that will help readers understand what is happening in the story. In the previous verse, the author described how “the sons of Israel went down with” Ehud “from the hill country.” This sentence explains that they had the courage to do that because Ehud had announced that Yahweh had promised them victory.

## Judges 3:31 (#4) (id: 777099)

**"with a goad of the ox"**

To make their cattle move, farmers in this culture would poke them with a long tool that had a point at one end. This tool was called a **goad**. If your readers would not be familiar with this object, in your translation you could use the name of a similar object that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: \[with a pole used to urge cattle to move] or \[with a pole used to direct cattle]

## Judges - Chapter 4 Introduction (id: 777100)

Judges 4 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

### The place of this story in the book

To this point, after giving an introduction to the stories of the judges (1:1–3:6\), the author has briefly described the work of three judges: Othniel (3:7–11\), Ehud (3:12–30\), and Shamgar (3:31\). In this chapter, he describes at more length the work of another judge, Deborah, and the man she called and helped to lead an Israelite army, Barak.

### The ending of the story

In verses 23 and 24, the author ends the story with a summary of what happened. He presents the information in a special form called a chiasm, in which the first and last parts match and the middle parts match. These parts match: “So on that day God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan” and “until that they destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan.” These parts also match: “to the face of the sons of Israel” and “For going, the hand of the sons of Israel went and {became} severe against Jabin, the king of Canaan.” You may be able to show this in your translation by using some special formatting. For example: So on that day God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan to the face of the sons of Israel For going, the hand of the sons of Israel went and {became} severe against Jabin, the king of Canaan until that they destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### How had Yahweh already begun to fight Sisera before the Israelites attacked?

In [4:14](https://ref.ly/Judg4:14), Deborah tells Barak that it is time to attack Sisera’s forces because Yahweh has already begun to fight against them. It is not clear from this chapter entirely what this means. But readers learn in the next chapter that there was a great storm on the day of this battle. Deborah says in her song (in [5:4](https://ref.ly/Judg5:4)) that when Yahweh marched out, “dark clouds dripped down water” and “the earth shook” (perhaps a reference to thunder). She speaks in [5:21](https://ref.ly/Judg5:21) of the Kishon River flooding. The historian Josephus writes of this battle that “as soon as the armies were engaged, there arose a prodigious tempest of hail and rain, which drove in the faces of the Canaanites, and occasioned a total rout of them.” With the rain, hail, and flooding, Sisera’s forces were not able to make use of their chariots. Barak was able to lead his troops down from the relative safety of Mount Tabor onto the plain and destroy Sisera’s army and its chariots.

### “Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman”

When Deborah tells Barak to raise an army to oppose Sisera, he replies, “If you will go with me, then I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go” ([4:8](https://ref.ly/Judg4:8)). Deborah agrees to go with him, but she also tells him that the credit and honor for killing Sisera will not go to him but to a woman. Interpreters have many different ideas about what this means. One possibility is that Barak was insisting on having visible, tangible assurance of God’s presence and help in the person of Deborah, who was a prophetess. Deborah graciously agreed to accompany Barak and provide this assurance, but at the same time she indicated to him that God’s power was so great that Barak should not have put this condition on his obedience. God would use a woman, who in this culture would not have been a warrior, to kill Sisera. At this time, great honor came from killing an enemy commander, and this honor would not go to Barak but to this woman and ultimately to God, who would arrange the circumstances for it. However, it is not necessary to resolve the meaning of this exchange in order to translate this passage. You can report the conversation between Deborah and Barak naturally in your translation without adding any interpretation.

**"king of Canaan"**

**Canaan** was not a single kingdom; it was an area in which there were many different cities and territories ruled by different kings.

**"and draw out"**

For elegance of expression and to emphasize the certainty of what he is saying, in this verse and the next one Yahweh uses the same verb in two different senses. Here, **draw out** means to recruit men for an army. In the next verse, it refers to how Yahweh will lure Sisera unsuspectingly into a situation where he and his army will be destroyed. Your language may have a verb that can be used in both of these senses. But if trying to use the same word in both places would be unclear, you could express the meaning.

The author is using **Barak**, the commander of the Israelite army, to mean the entire army. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[But Barak and the soldiers he commanded]

## Judges - Chapter 5 Introduction (id: 777175)

Judges 5 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, the author presents a song that Deborah and Barak sang to celebrate the victory that Yahweh enabled them to win over Sisera.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations, prayers, and songs with special formatting. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of chapter 5, which is a song, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### How were the Israelites able to fight against Sisera if they had no weapons?

In [5:8](https://ref.ly/Judg5:8), this song describes how Jabin’s occupying soldiers took away the weapons that the Israelites had. So how were the Israelites able to fight a battle against Sisera’s forces? As a note to [4:2](https://ref.ly/Judg4:2) explains, the name Harosheth Haggoyim may describe a place where Jabin forced captive peoples to cut wood for him. It has been suggested that the conscripted Israelites who joined Barak’s army took their axes and hatchets with them and used them as weapons.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Hebrew poetry

Except for a brief introduction and conclusion, this chapter is poetry that consists of pairs of phrases that repeat the same meaning. The second phrase advances the idea of the first by affirming, contrasting, or supplementing it in different words. (Sometimes there is a third line with similar meaning.) Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both (or all three) phrases in your translation. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the idea of the first one, not saying something different. For example, in [5:2](https://ref.ly/Judg5:2) you might say, “For the loosening of long hair in Israel, yes, for the volunteering of the people.” (See: Parallelism)

### Deborah and Barak singing this song together

While the author says in [5:1](https://ref.ly/Judg5:1) that both “Deborah and Barak” sang this song, the first\-person verbs and pronouns in it are singular. It was common for the Israelites to sing in responsive parts, so it may be that Deborah and Barak each sang parts of this song individually, responding to one another. For example, it seems probable that in [5:12](https://ref.ly/Judg5:12) Barak sang “awake, Deborah” and Deborah responded “Arise, Barak.”

Hebrew does not mark first\-person pronouns or verbs for gender, so it is not clear in many cases which of them sang which parts, although in some cases the text does give us a fair idea. For the sake of languages that do mark first\-person singular pronouns or verbs for gender, here are some suggestions as to who might be singing when the song says “I” or “my.” This is, however, largely a matter of interpretation, so use your own best judgment in your translation. Since Deborah and Barak are, in a sense, speaking for each other, another alternative would be to use plural first\-person pronouns. (See: Pronouns — When to Use Them and Singular Pronouns that refer to Groups)

* In [5:3](https://ref.ly/Judg5:3), you could consider using masculine forms for “I … {even} I, let me sing” and feminine forms for “I will make music.” The verb translated as “make music” refers to singing with an instrumental accompaniment. Deborah was a prophetess, and the Old Testament prophets appear to have sung at least some of their prophecies to instrumental accompaniment. (See, for example, [Ezekiel 33:32](https://ref.ly/Ezek33:32).) So it is perhaps more likely that Deborah sang “I will make music” and Barak sang “let me sing.”
* Deborah is speaking of herself as “I” in [5:7](https://ref.ly/Judg5:7), so it would be appropriate to use feminine forms there.
* It has been suggested that in [5:9](https://ref.ly/Judg5:9), it would be more appropriate for Deborah to thank the leaders, who would have included Barak, and for Barak to thank those who volunteered in response to his summons. So you may wish to mark “My” as feminine.
* Barak is probably referring to himself as “me” in [5:13](https://ref.ly/Judg5:13), since he was the one who led the Israelite army “against the warriors” of Sisera.
* Barak seems to be speaking in [5:15](https://ref.ly/Judg5:15), “my commanders in Issachar were with Deborah,” because otherwise Deborah would be speaking of herself in the third person, which she does not seem to do in this song.
* It has been suggested that in [5:21](https://ref.ly/Judg5:21), Barak may have described the Kishon River flooding, since he saw this first\-hand in the battle, and then said, “March on, my soul, in strength,” recalling how the Israelite soldiers pursued the attack against Sisera vigorously when they saw how the flooding had put them and their chariots at a disadvantage.

### A different setting for part of the song

There is an apparent change of setting in [5:10–11](https://ref.ly/Judg5:10-Judg5:11), from the original performance of the song at a victory celebration to its repeated recitation at places where travelers stopped along the road for water. In this part of the song, Deborah and Barak are not addressing people who are not present as if they could hear them. That is a poetic device that writers and speakers in the Bible sometimes use, but it does not occur here. Rather, verses 10 and 11 of the song reflect its later use at “watering places” to commemorate the victory over Sisera and Jabin. So translate verse 10 as a direct address to people who are present.

## Judges 5:1 (#1) (id: 777176)

**"on that day"**

As in [4:23](https://ref.ly/Judg4:23), here the word **day** may refer not to a single day but to a more general time. The author may not mean that Deborah and Barak sang this song on the actual day on which the Israelites defeated the forces of King Jabin, but rather during that general time. Alternate translation: \[at the time when the Israelites defeated the forces of King Jabin]

## Judges 5:1 (#2) (id: 777177)

**"So Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang on that day, saying"**

The author is using the term **saying** to introduce a direct quotation of the song that Deborah and Barak **sang**. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: \[So Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang the following song on that day]

**"For the loosening of long hair in Israel, for the volunteering of the people"**

This is the beginning of the song that Deborah and Barak sang. You may wish to indicate this with an opening first\-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a first\-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the song as poetry, as the ULT does.

## Judges 5:2 (#3) (id: 777180)

**"For the loosening of long hair in Israel"**

While scholars disagree about how to translate and understand this phrase, it seems to be describing the practice of taking a vow not to cut one’s hair until a certain objective is achieved, in this case, the defeat of Sisera’s army. Growing long hair was thus a symbolic action that expressed the determination to achieve this objective. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: \[For the Israelites who vowed to defeat Sisera’s army]

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 5:2
* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Action (ID: `33402@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 5:2 (#4) (id: 777181)

**"For the loosening of long hair in Israel"**

For emphasis and poetic effect, Deborah and Barak are using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. That is, the word translated as **long hair** describes hair that is flowing freely or loosely, and the word translated as **loosening** describes not braiding that hair or binding it with a turban. Your language may have terms available that will allow you to use the same construction in your translation to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis and poetic effect, if you do not express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: \[For freely flowing hair in Israel]

## Judges 5:3 (#1) (id: 777184)

**"Listen, kings! Give ear, rulers"**

Deborah and Barak are speaking to two groups that they know cannot hear them. They are doing this to show in a strong way how they feel about the story they are telling in their song. They feel that it is worth the attention of the most important people in the world. They are actually speaking to all the people who can hear them or who will hear them. ([5:10–11](https://ref.ly/Judg5:10-Judg5:11) indicates that this includes people from throughout Israelite society.) If your readers might not understand what Deborah and Barak are doing, you could translate their words as if they were speaking directly to people who were present.

**"Yahweh, at your going forth from Seir, at your marching from the field of Edom"**

The song is speaking as if Yahweh had literally traveled from or across the land of **Seir**, that is, **Edom**, in order to lead the Israelites into battle against Sisera. This could mean: (1\) that the song is envisioning Mount Sinai as Yahweh’s dwelling place on earth and describing the route that Yahweh would have taken from there to the battlefield. Alternate translation: \[Yahweh, when you came across Seir to fight against Sisera, when you marched across the fields of Edom] (2\) that the song is referring to the time when the Israelites left Edom to start conquering the people in Canaan and speaking of Yahweh as if he had been a warrior leading the Israelite army at that time. Alternate translation: \[Yahweh, it was just like the time when you first led our armies into Canaan from Seir. It was as if you marched ahead of us across the fields of Edom]

**"The mountains flowed"**

The song is speaking as if the **mountains** above the battlefield had literally **flowed** down onto it. This seems to be a reference to the way the downpour made the mountain streams overflow. (Ultimately, they fed into the Kishon River, and it flooded the battlefield. See [5:21](https://ref.ly/Judg5:21).) This might also be an allusion to the way that the overflowing streams would have carried dirt, branches, rocks, etc., down from the mountains, as if the mountains themselves were coming down onto the plain. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[The mountain streams overflowed]

**"this {is} Sinai from the face of Yahweh"**

The song is saying that what happened to the mountains above the battlefield was just like what happened when Yahweh appeared to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. When he did, according to [Exodus 19:16–18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:16-Exod19:18), there was also a thunderstorm and the mountain shook. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[just as Mount Sinai trembled when Yahweh appeared there in a storm]

## Judges 5:6 (#2) (id: 777193)

**"roads ceased"**

The song is speaking as if the **roads** in Israel had literally **ceased** to exist. It means that people stopped using the main roads because it had become too dangerous to travel on them. Jabin’s forces were apparently occupying Israel, and his soldiers would plunder the goods that anyone was transporting. (This means that, in a sense, the roads literally did cease to exist, since they were dirt roads and grass would have grown back over them. One translation option would be to say this and let readers realize the implications.) Alternate translation: \[people stopped using the main roads] or \[grass grew back over the roads]

You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[and travelers had to take roundabout back routes]

**"The peasantry ceased in Israel, they ceased, until when I, Deborah, arose, when I arose, a mother in Israel"**

Deborah is repeating the verbs **ceased** and **arose** in order to intensify the ideas that they express. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis.

The meaning is that no one was living in the countryside anymore because the rural people hid in the mountains or moved into fortified cities for safety. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[Everyone had to move from the countryside into the cities where it was safer]

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language.

**"after you, Benjamin, with your peoples"**

Here the song could be speaking to a group of people who are not there to hear it, the people of the tribe of **Benjamin**, in order to express strong approval of the way the soldiers from that tribe came and fought for Israel. The song would actually be speaking to the people who could hear it, initially the soldiers and others who gathered for the victory celebration at which it was first performed. However, some people from the tribe of Benjamin probably were present at the celebration, so the direct address with **you** and **your** could be literal. On the other hand, as [5:9–10](https://ref.ly/Judg5:9-Judg5:10) shows, this song was later sung in other contexts where people from Benjamin were not necessarily present. So it may be clearer in some languages to translate this without using second\-person pronouns and to express the emphasis in some other way.

Alternate translation: \[You should not have stayed among the sheepfolds, as if it was more important to listen to the piping for the flocks!]

**"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds? To hear the piping for the flocks"**

The song is speaking to someone who is not present. It is doing this to express a strong feeling about that person to the people who are present. If a speaker of your language would not address someone who was not present, you could translate this as if the song were directly addressing those who are present. Alternate translation: \[Reuben should not have stayed among the sheepfolds, as if it were more important to listen to the piping for the flocks]

**"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds"**

The word **you** is singular here because the song is addressing this tribe as if it were a single person, its ancestor Reuben. It may be more natural in some languages to use a plural form of “you,” since a group of people is actually being addressed.

## Judges 5:16 (#4) (id: 777242)

**"To hear the piping for the flocks"**

The song is implicitly making a comparison that it expects listeners to recognize. When Barak summoned the Israelites in [4:10](https://ref.ly/Judg4:10), it is likely that he blew a shofar (ram’s horn), as Ehud did in [3:27](https://ref.ly/Judg3:27). The song is suggesting that the men of Reuben so much enjoyed listening to shepherds play their pipes to summon their flocks that they did not pay attention to the war trumpet. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[Was it because you would rather listen to shepherd’s pipes than respond to the call of the war trumpet?]

**"and Dan, why did he sojourn {on} ships"**

The song is using the present tense to describe habitual action. During the battle against Sisera, the people of the tribe of Dan continued to do what they usually did. Their territory included the harbor of Joppa, and so they were devoted to the pursuits of fishing and maritime trading. But since the song is referring specifically to what the people of Dan did on a specific occasion, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: \[and Dan, why did he sojourn on ships]

It is using the stars to represent the forces of nature, particularly those in the sky, and celebrating the way Yahweh used those forces to defeat Sisera.

The singer, who is probably Barak at this point (see the General Notes to this chapter), is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of himself. He is putting himself back in the time of the battle and encouraging himself to fight vigorously since Yahweh is already defeating Sisera with natural forces. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, and you could express it from the time perspective of the victory celebration, that is, as a past event, as in the first sentence of the verse.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to make this more than one sentence. Alternate translation: \[She told herself that Sisera and his soldiers must be searching the battlefield for plunder and dividing it up. Each soldier, she thought, must be claiming a woman or two as concubines. She also thought that the soldiers must each be finding one or two dyed, embroidered robes that they could wear]

**"But {may} the lovers of him {be"**

**"like the going forth of the sun in its strength"**

The **strength** of the sun could be its brightness or its heat. So the point of this comparison may be that just as the sun, once it rises, is too bright to look at or so hot that people must get out of its rays into the shade, so no one will be able to resist those who love Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: \[irresistibly strong, like the unbearable brightness of the risen sun] or \[irresistibly strong, like the unbearable heat of the risen sun]

But it may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

**"Yahweh {is} with you"**

Verses 14 and 16 identify this **angel** as Yahweh himself. So here Yahweh is actually speaking about himself in the third person. However, Gideon does not yet know that Yahweh is appearing to him in the form of this angel. So it would be appropriate to leave this statement in the third person.

## Judges 6:22 (#3) (id: 777358)

**"Alas, my Lord Yahweh"**

Gideon is using a word that expresses a strong feeling, fear. The ULT translates this word as **Alas**. There may be an equivalent word or expression in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this strong feeling. If not, you could specify that Gideon said this because he was feeling fear. Alternate translation: \[Oh, no, my Lord Yahweh] or \[I am afraid, my Lord Yahweh]

**"on the head of this stronghold"**

Yahweh assumes that Gideon will understand that by **the head of this stronghold**, he is referring to the top of a rocky cliff in the town of Ophrah. The people of the town could go there for safety from the Midianites, and since it was a high place, it was also where Gideon’s father had built an altar.

**"the house of his father"**

The author is using the term **house** by association to mean a group of people who were living together, not necessarily all in the same building. Gideon’s **father** was the head of this household, which probably included family members in several generations and servants. Alternate translation: \[the people in his extended family]

## Judges 6:27 (#2) (id: 777372)

**"and the men of the city"**

Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. While the males in the city were the most likely to attack Gideon for tearing down the altar of Baal, he probably feared any person—man or woman, adult or child—who would recognize him and identify him as the person who had done that. Alternate translation: \[and the people of the city]

**"and behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah that {was} beside it was cut down, and the second bullock had been offered on the built altar"**

If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express these ideas with active forms or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: \[and they saw that someone had torn down the altar of Baal, cut down the Asherah that was beside it, built an altar, and offered the second bullock on it]

The expression just means that one person asked another. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[Each person was asking other people]

**"And they searched and sought, and they said"**

The terms **searched** and **sought** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis, probably to mean that it took some time to find out who was responsible. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[They had to search for some time, but finally they discovered]

**"that he may die"**

The men of the city mean implicitly that they want Joash to surrender Gideon to them so that they can execute him as a punishment.

**"who stood against him"**

This is a common expression that describes these people opposing Joash in an argument. The emphasis is not on their body position, although they likely were standing around his house. The idea is that they wanted Joash to bring Gideon out to them, but he refused, so the people were in opposition **against** Joash. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[who were arguing with him]

**"Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him"**

Joash is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: \[You should not have to contend for Baal! You should not have to help him!]

**"Whoever contends for him, may he die"**

Joash is saying implicitly that anyone who thinks he needs to act to defend Baal’s honor is suggesting that Baal is not powerful enough to defend his own honor, and that is being just as disrespectful to Baal as the person who tore down his altar. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[Whoever contends for him is being just as disrespectful, and he is the one who deserves to die]

It is unclear how many of the words that follow **saying** were spoken by the people who gave Gideon the name **Jerubbaal** and how many are an explanation by the author of why the people gave him this name. The people could have spoken: (1\) all of the words that are within quotation marks in the ULT. This would be a repetition of what Joash said at the end of the previous verse. (2\) only the first phrase that is within quotation marks in the ULT. This would explain the meaning of the name Jerubbaal. The rest would be an explanation by the author.

The pronoun **them** could refer to: (1\) Gideon and the soldiers from Manasseh whom he was commanding. This would suit the sense of the verb **went up**, since [7:9](https://ref.ly/Judg7:9) indicates that Gideon was staying on some high ground above the battlefield. Alternate translation: \[and soldiers from those tribes went up to meet Gideon and the soldiers from Manasseh whom he was commanding] (2\) the enemy armies.

### Why does the barley loaf represent Gideon?

In [7:13](https://ref.ly/Judg7:13), a Midianite soldier tells his friend that the loaf of barley bread in the dream the friend has just recounted must represent Gideon. He says this because barley was a grain that only poorer people ate, and as [6:6](https://ref.ly/Judg6:6) states, the Midianites had reduced the Israelites to poverty. In [6:11](https://ref.ly/Judg6:11), Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites; they may have taken the wheat from Israel but left the barley because they did not want to eat it. Beyond this, the “sons of the east” were nomadic herders, so they would have associated grain with a farming culture such as the Israelites had. For these reasons, the soldier recognizes that the loaf of barley bread represents the Israelite army under the command of Gideon. A note to verse 13 suggests a way to indicate this in your translation.

### Mount Gilead

In [7:3](https://ref.ly/Judg7:3), Yahweh tells Gideon to announce to his troops that anyone who is afraid can depart from “Mount Gilead.” In this context, that name cannot refer, as it usually does, to the mountainous region east of the Jordan River. The Valley of Jezreel, where the two armies had gathered for battle, was west of the Jordan River. Since Gilead was the ancestor of a major part of the tribe of Manasseh, including the Abiezrites, and since that tribe had territory on both sides of the Jordan, it is possible that the people of Manasseh had named a mountain after Gilead on the west side of the river, near where Gideon’s army had assembled. But such a mountain is not known from any other source. Some commentators have suggested instead that “Mount Gilead” might have been a name that the soldiers of Manasseh gave to their army, to describe both its strength and its lineage. However, there is no evidence elsewhere for that either. But since this is ultimately a matter of interpretation rather than of translation, is probably best to translate the expression as “Mount Gilead” and allow preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain the possible meanings.

### “into their hand”/“into your hand” (plural “you”)

In several places in this chapter, the author or characters use the expressions “into their hand” and “into your hand” (with a plural “you”). Since this expression refers to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. (See: Collective Nouns)

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 7:1
* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: `33324@UWTranslationManual`)

## Judges 7:1 (#1) (id: 777401)

**"Harod"** \- **"Moreh"**

The word **Harod** means “trembling.” The spring probably got this name because, as [7:3](https://ref.ly/Judg7:3) describes, all the soldiers who were “afraid and trembling” were dismissed from Gideon’s army there. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in a footnote.

**"for my giving Midian into their hand"**

Here Yahweh is using the term **hand** in the sense of possession. The image is of someone holding something in his hand. That is, when Yahweh speaks of **giving Midian into** the **hand** of the Israelites, the idea is that the Israelites will conquer the Midianites, who will then become subject to them.

Judges 8 General Notes
======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The account of Gideon concludes in this chapter.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### The tower in Penuel

Ancient cities and towns often built protective towers. Their citizens could go inside them for safety, and from the top of them their soldiers had an advantage in fighting attacking armies. The leaders of Penuel probably thought that they were safe from the Midianites because they had such a tower. Gideon told them that he was going to tear down their tower to show that they should have taken his side in the fight against the Midianites.

### Why did Gideon kill the men of Penuel?

It seems difficult to understand why, when Gideon returned to Penuel (8:17\), he “killed the men of the city.” He had only said he would tear down their tower, just as he had only told the leaders of Succoth that he would whip them with thorny branches, and that was all he did to them. Here is one possible explanation. In 8:16, the author uses the phrase “the men of Succoth” to mean the same thing as “the elders of the city.” So the phrase “the men of the city” in 8:17 may refer to the town leaders of Penuel. The author may be saying that when Gideon tore down the tower, this killed the town leaders. That may have happened because those leaders took refuge in the tower, thinking they would be safe from Gideon there because he would not be able to tear down the tower or that he would not tear it down if they were in it. A note to 8:17 suggests an alternate translation that suggests this meaning.

### Why did Gideon tell his son Jether to kill the Midianite kings?

In 8:20, Gideon tells his son Jether, who was still a young man, to kill the Midianite kings Zeba and Zalmunna. This was in some way a symbolic action, but interpreters are not entirely sure of what kind. Here are some possibilities: (1\) Gideon could have been intending to give an honor to his son. Gideon had already appeased the Ephraimites by telling them what an honor it had been for them to kill Oreb and Zeeb ([8:3](https://ref.ly/Judg8:3)), and he may have wanted his firstborn son to have a similar honor. If that is the significance of this action, in your translation you might have Gideon say to Jether, “I will give you the honor of killing these kings.” (2\) Gideon could have been intending to dishonor Zeba and Zalmunna. They had apparently killed Gideon’s brothers by murder rather than in battle, and so Gideon did not consider them worthy of being killed by a person of status, such as himself. (In this culture, it was customary for someone to be executed by a person of equal status; see, for example, [1 Kings 2:29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:29).) If that is the significance, you might have Gideon say to Jether, “I am going to have you, a youth, kill them.” (3\) Gideon could have wanted to emphasize to Jether that he needed to be prepared to fight against the oppressors of Yahweh’s people, just as he had. In that case, you might have Gideon say, “Kill these enemy kings, as you must be prepared to fight to free Yahweh’s people from oppression.”

## Judges 8:1 (#1) (id: 777468)

**"What {is} this thing you have done to us, not calling to us when you went to fight against Midian"**

The soldiers from Ephraim are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: \[You should not have acted toward us like this! When you went out to fight against the army of Midian, you should have called us to help you!]

## Judges 8:2 (#1) (id: 777470)

**"What have I now done like you? {Are} not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer"**

Gideon is using the question form in order to make a point without being confrontational. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations, particularly if they would not be regarded as confrontational in your culture. Alternate translation: \[What I have done is not like what you have done! The gleanings of Ephraim are better than the vintage of Abiezer!]

## Judges 8:2 (#2) (id: 777471)

**"Are} not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer"**

Gideon is speaking as if he had literally harvested a crop of grapes and the soldiers from Ephraim had come along after him and collected the few grapes that he had left on the vines. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (You could also express this as a comparison, as the UST does.) Alternate translation: \[The specific thing that you did at the end of the battle was more important than what I and my soldiers did during the battle!]

The author is using the term **word** to represent what Gideon said by using words. He is not referring to one specific **word** that Gideon spoke that made the Ephraimite soldiers less angry.

**"Then Gideon came to the Jordan. Crossing over, he and the 300 men who {were} with him {were} weary, but pursuing"**

Here the author is introducing a new event in the story. It is possible that he is backing up to a point in the narrative just after [7:24](https://ref.ly/Judg7:24) and that the events of [7:25–8:3](https://ref.ly/Judg7:25-Judg8:3) are related out of sequence. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event and that would allow for this possibility.

The leaders of Succoth are referring by association to Gideon and his men having captured Zebah and Zalmunna.

## Judges 8:16 (#2) (id: 777506)

**"and he taught"**

The traditional Hebrew text reads **taught** here. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient versions seem to reflect a different textual reading and say “thrashed,” as in [8:7](https://ref.ly/Judg8:7). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. However, if the original reading is “taught,” in this context the word would mean “disciplined,” so the two readings mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: \[and he disciplined]

## Judges 8:18 (#1) (id: 777508)

**"Where {are} the men whom you killed at Tabor"**

Gideon’s question relates to something that the author has not narrated as part of this story. The author has also not related it as background information. So readers must infer what happened. It appears that at some point, probably before Yahweh called Gideon to lead an army against the Midianites, their soldiers came into Israel and murdered some of Gideon’s brothers. Because these forces were under the command or authority of Zebah and Zalmunna, Gideon is going to hold them accountable for his brothers’ deaths. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[Now some time ago your forces killed some men at Tabor. You need to answer for that]

**"Where {are} the men whom you killed at Tabor"**

This could mean: (1\) that Gideon is asking for information. He wants to verify the identity of the men whom these kings killed. Alternate translation: \[What did the men look like whom you killed at Tabor?] (2\) that Gideon is using the question form to announce that he is going to hold Zebah and Zalmunna accountable for the deaths of his brothers. This question seems to have had that significance in this culture. For example, for the same purpose, God says to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” ([Genesis 4:9](https://ref.ly/Gen4:9)).

Zebah and Zalmunna could be: (1\) saying implicitly that they killed these men because they were of regal bearing and so they perceived them to be a potential threat. As Israelites of strength and influence, they could have led resistance to the Midianites. Alternate translation: \[They were of regal bearing, just like you, and we killed them because we perceived them as a threat] (2\) answering Gideon’s question by providing information.

They may regard him as the “king” of Israel because he has led the Israelite forces into battle. In that case, by **the sons of the king**, they would be referring to Gideon’s sons, at least one of whom is present, as [8:20](https://ref.ly/Judg8:20) indicates.

Unfortunately this seems to have made Abimelek ambitious to become an actual king, with disastrous consequences, as Chapter 9 describes.

Since Yahweh **delivered** the Israelites before they failed to **remember** him, in your translation you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. The UST models one way to do this.

**"And"** \- **"did not remember"**

He means that they were not grateful to Yahweh and so did not respond the way grateful people would, with loyal devotion. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Judges - Chapter 9 Introduction (id: 777561)

Judges 9 General Notes
======================

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### “upon one stone”

The author says in 9:5 that Abimelek and the men he hired brought all of his half\-brothers, the other sons of Gideon, to “one stone” and killed them there. There seems to have been some symbolic significance to this action. The stone might have been a place of formal execution. Abimelek could have killed his half\-brothers there to indicate that he had taken authority as king and so no threats to his rule should be allowed to exist. The stone might also have been a religious altar of some kind. Some interpreters believe that Abimelek and the leaders of Shechem were executing Gideon’s sons on a stone altar to avenge his desecration of Baal’s altar. This would explain why money from the temple of Baal\-Berith paid for the action. However, since the exact purpose is unclear, it would be best to say no more about this in your translation than the original text does.

### Jotham’s curse

In 9:20, Jotham, the one son of Gideon who survived Abimelek’s massacre, says, “may fire go forth from Abimelek and may it consume the lords of Shechem and Beth Millo, and may fire go forth from the lords of Shechem and from Beth Millo and may it consume Abimelek.” This was a curse. Jotham was expressing a desire for bad things to happen to the people who had murdered the sons of the man who had delivered them from the Midianites. What Jotham was ultimately wishing for was God’s justice. He wanted people who had done such bad things to have bad things happen to them. His curse was fulfilled in a literal way when Abimelek burned the lords of Shechem to death in 9:49\. (See: Curse)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### Jotham’s parable about the trees

In 9:8–15, Gideon’s surviving son, Jotham, tells the lords of Shechem a parable. A parable is a short story that teaches something that is true. It delivers its lesson in a way that is easy to understand and hard to forget. In many cases, the events in a parable could happen, though they did not actually happen. But in this case, they could not have happened, since this parable is about trees talking to each other about appointing a king. However, either way, the events of a parable are told only to teach the lesson that the listeners are meant to learn. See the first note to 9:8 for suggestions about how to introduce and begin this parable in your translation.

### Did God send an “evil spirit” to Shechem?

In [9:23](https://ref.ly/Judg9:23), the author says that God sent a “bad spirit” that made the lords of Shechem hostile toward Abimelek. The word that the ULT translates as “bad” can also mean “evil,” depending on the context. Some versions of the Bible in various languages translate it as “evil” here. Translators may have encountered that reading. However, the context does not seem to support it. The teaching of the Bible as a whole suggests that God would not use something evil to accomplish his purposes. Also, evil spirits have rebelled against God, and so they have forfeited the right to be part of what he is doing. Moreover, the word “spirit” does not necessarily refer to a spiritual being here. It could refer instead to the attitude that Abimelek and the lords of Shechem had toward one another. This would be the same meaning as in [8:3](https://ref.ly/Judg8:3), “their spirit abated toward him,” which means, “they no longer had a hostile attitude toward him.” So it seems appropriate to understand the author to be saying in 9:23 that God caused hostility between Abimelek and the lords of Shechem.

### Why did Gaal go and stand in the gate of Shechem?

In [9:35](https://ref.ly/Judg9:35), the author says that “Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city” of Shechem. He does not say explicitly why Gaal did this. Gaal does not seem to have known that Abimelek and his troops were nearby, since Zebul was able to convince him otherwise at first (as the next verse describes). Gaal, given his boast against Abimelek at the temple banquet, may have wanted to watch and see whether there was any danger. He may have expected to be able to see approaching troops while they were still far away and arrange a defense before they arrived. But since the author does not say explicitly why Gaal went out to the city gate, it would probably be best not to suggest any reason for this in your translation.

### Why did the people of Shechem go out of their city the day after Abimelek defeated Gaal?

In 9:42, the author says that the people of Shechem went out of their city the day after Abimelek defeated Gaal, but he does not say why. In this verse, “went out” does not seem to describe a military operation, as it does in 9:39 in the case of Gaal. Instead, the people of Shechem seem to have thought mistakenly that they could let Gaal try to defeat Abimelek and become their ruler and that, if he failed, they could still serve Abimelek. So they were probably just going out to work in their fields. You may find it appropriate to use a different expression in your translation for “went out” in 9:42 than you do for that phrase in 9:39\.

A **silver** shekel weighed about 11 grams, so these **70** shekels weighed a little less than a kilogram, or almost two pounds. In your translation, you could use the ancient measurement and spell the word “shekel” the way it sounds in your language. You could also say “coins” rather than “shekels.” Alternatively, you could use the metric measurement given in the UST or another measurement that your language and culture customarily use, or you could use the ancient measurement in your translation and put a modern measurement in parentheses in the text or in a footnote.

## Judges 9:6 (#2) (id: 777584)

**"beside the oak of the pillar that {was} in Shechem"**

The author assumes that readers will know what **oak** and **pillar** he is referring to. Joshua had set up the pillar under that oak there in Shechem as a witness of the covenant that the Israelites had made with Yahweh to worship him alone as their God ([Joshua 24:26–27](https://ref.ly/Josh24:26-Josh24:27)).

**"beside the oak of the pillar that {was} in Shechem"**

Making Abimelek **king** next to this **pillar** under this **oak** tree was a symbolic action, given the history of the place. Since the lords of Shechem had given Abimelek money from the temple of Baal\-Berith to establish himself as king, Baal\-Berith was Abimelek’s patron god. So the location of this ceremony was intended to signify that, in place of their covenant with Yahweh, the people were installing a king who would lead them in the worship of Baal\-Berith. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: \[under the patronage of Baal\-Berith, beside the very same oak tree in Shechem where Joshua had set up a pillar to remind the Israelites of their covenant with Yahweh]

**"Mount Gerizim"**

Jotham choosing **Mount Gerizim** as the place from which to shout his message was a symbolic action. In [Deuteronomy 11:29](https://ref.ly/Deut11:29) and [Deuteronomy 27:12–26](https://ref.ly/Deut27:12-Deut27:26), Moses had commanded the Israelites to proclaim blessings for keeping Yahweh’s law from Mount Gerizim and curses for breaking Yahweh’s law from the facing Mount Ebal. [Joshua 8:32–34](https://ref.ly/Josh8:32-Josh8:34) records how Joshua carried out this command. So the location was a reminder of how the people of Israel would be blessed if they remained faithful to Yahweh and cursed if they did not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: \[Mount Gerizim, opposite where curses had been proclaimed against unfaithfulness to Yahweh]

Alternate translation: \[I am not going to discontinue my fatness, by which they honor gods and men, in order to go wave over the trees!]

**"that I should go to wave over the trees"**

The olive tree is using the term **wave** to suggest implicitly that being a king over the other trees would not be as worthwhile or productive as continuing to make olives for oil. Trees stay rooted in the ground, so the olive tree is using the word **wave**, meaning to sway back and forth in the wind, to represent how kings go around taking care of various official matters. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do this.

**"come, shelter in my shade"**

In the story, the thornbush is speaking as if the other trees would literally **shelter** in its **shade**, that is, find protection there from the heat of the sun. This was an image that people in this culture used to describe coming under the protection of a ruler and accordingly accepting an obligation to obey that ruler. [Isaiah 30:2](https://ref.ly/Isa30:2), for example, speaks of the Judeans sheltering in the shadow of Egypt, meaning that they agreed to allow Pharaoh to rule them in exchange for his protection. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[then obey me as your king]

**"come, shelter in my shade"**

Jotham’s parable is designed to make the lords of Shechem realize that they have made a great mistake by giving Abimelek the means to kill all of his brothers and then anointing him as king. One way the parable does this is by having one of its characters, the thornbush, say something that is the opposite of the way things really are. A thornbush does not create any **shade** in which anyone or anything can **shelter**. Similarly, Abimelek will not do anything worthwhile for the people of Shechem. He will only cause great trouble for them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could reflect in your translation how what the thornbush says is the opposite of the way things are.

In verses 16–19, Jotham is describing a condition in which a second event should take place only if a first event has taken place. He makes a series of “if” statements in verses 16 and 19 (suggesting in verses 17 and 18 that these statements are not actually true), and then in the second half of verse 19 he says what the lords of Shechem should do if they have done what he has described. These verses are all one long sentence. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate them as a series of shorter sentences. Alternate translation: \[So now, suppose you have acted in truth and in integrity and made Abimelek reign. Suppose you have done good with Jerubbaal and with his house.

**"if you have acted in truth and in integrity and made Abimelek reign"**

In his explanation of the parable, Jotham carries the implications of the idea of **truth** one step farther than in the parable. That term refers to faithfully fulfilling relational responsibilities towards another person. In a sense, just as the trees were not doing right by the thornbush by anointing it king just because the other trees refused, so the lords of Shechem are not doing right by Abimelek by supporting his murderous plot to become king. They should have encouraged him to be honest and humble and peaceful instead. But the person they are most significantly not doing right by is Gideon. Jotham will develop this idea at length in the verses that follow. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

The word translated as **but** shows that in this verse, Jotham is drawing a contrast between the way the lords of Shechem should implicitly have treated Gideon and what they actually did to his descendants. In your translation, introduce this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Since this contrasting material is supplemental to the if\-then condition that Jotham develops over the course of verses 16–19, you may want to use punctuation to set it apart in some way, such as by setting it off with dashes, as the ULT does, or by putting it in parentheses.

## Judges 9:18 (#3) (id: 777637)

**"have arisen"**

Jotham is using the word **arisen** within a common expression in which it ordinarily describes subjects revolting against their rulers. In [8:23](https://ref.ly/Judg8:23), Gideon refused to become king and to have his son and grandson be kings after him, so the lords of Shechem did not literally revolt against the rule of Gideon’s family. Jotham’s point may be that if anyone were to be their king, it should have been Gideon’s legal heirs (just as the olive tree, fig tree, and grapevine would have made better kings than the thornbush), so in that sense making Abimelek king was a revolt against those who should have been accepted as authorities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[have revolted]

## Judges 9:18 (#5) (id: 777639)

**"the son of his female slave"**

The author says in [8:31](https://ref.ly/Judg8:31) that Abimelek’s mother was Gideon’s “concubine.” This means that she was a legal but secondary wife whose children did not have inheritance rights. While female slaves sometimes did become the concubines of their masters, not every concubine was a female slave. Abimelek’s mother seems to have come from a family of standing in Shechem; Gideon may have married her as a concubine rather than as a full wife because she was a foreigner, from the surviving Canaanite population of Shechem. So Jotham is disparaging her by calling her a **female slave**. His main point seems to be that Abimelek has no rights of inheritance and thus no claim to become king. (Unfortunately Gideon suggested otherwise when he named this son Abimelek, meaning “my father is king.”) You could bring out this emphasis in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[who has no rights of inheritance and so no claim to become king as Gideon’s son]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could explicitly state the implied “then” before that part of the statement.

Jotham is using fire to represent the destruction of warfare. He means that, if Abimelek and the lords of Shechem have not treated Gideon and his family right, then he hopes and expects that they will turn against each other and fight a war and destroy each other. (Part of what he said actually was fulfilled literally, when Abimelek burned the tower of Shechem, as verse 49 describes.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[may Abimelek and you lords of Shechem fight a war against each other that destroys all of you]

## Judges 9:21 (#1) (id: 777646)

**"Then Jotham escaped and fled"**

While the words **escaped** and **fled** mean similar things, the author does not seem to be using them together for emphasis (for example, to mean “hurriedly ran away”) or to express a single idea through them (for example, to mean “escaped by running away”). He seems to mean implicitly that Jotham **escaped** from Shechem, that is, he was able to shout his message without being captured, and then **fled** to the city of Beer where he was apparently safe from Abimelek. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[Then Jotham escaped from Shechem and fled for safety]

The author is using all of **Israel** to mean one part of Israel. The narrative suggests that Abimelek ruled primarily over the city of Shechem and its surrounding towns. (Recall from [1:7](https://ref.ly/Judg1:7) that in Canaan at this time, each city and town had a ruler who had the title of “king.”) His authority and influence may have extended somewhat farther from there, through the territory of Ephraim and possibly into neighboring tribes.

**"Who {is} Abimelek, and who {is} Shechem, that we should serve him"**

The first two phrases mean basically the same thing. Gaal is referring to the same person by the names **Abimelek** and **Shechem**. However, there is a slight difference in meaning. The second phrase makes a mild concession, indicating that perhaps there is some basis to serve Abimelek, since he is from the city of Shechem and his mother is related to the people who live there. (In [9:3](https://ref.ly/Judg9:3), the people of the city say of Abimelek, “He is our brother,” meaning “our kinsman.”) You may wish to indicate this in your translation.

Gaal is implicitly suggesting a reason why the people of Shechem should not serve Abimelek. His point is that Abimelek is the son of somebody outside their people group, an Israelite. Gaal may be using the name Jerubbaal instead of Gideon to make a further point, that Abimelek’s father opposed the worship of Baal, while the people of Shechem are devoted to Baal. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[He is the son of Jerubbaal, an Israelite who opposed the worship of Baal]

However, the author is instead reporting what Gaal said at this festival as a way of introducing **Zebul** as a new participant in the story. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain in a footnote that Zebul was a man whom Abimelek had appointed to govern Shechem whenever he himself was away from the city.

He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the others who are present at this feast. If your readers might not understand why Gaal is speaking to someone who is not present, you could translate his words as if he were speaking directly to others who are present.

**"and they ambushed against Shechem"**

The verb translated as **ambushed** here is the same one that was translated as “ambushers” in [9:25](https://ref.ly/Judg9:25) and as “hide” in [9:32](https://ref.ly/Judg9:32). Abimelek and his troops followed Zebul’s advice to hide so that they could not be seen and so that they could launch a surprise attack in the morning. Alternate translation: \[and they set up an ambush against Shechem]

**"But Zebul said to him"**

The author expects readers to understand implicitly that Zebul is not sharing an honest opinion with Gaal. Zebul is trying to deceive him into thinking that Abimelek has not yet arrived, so that Gaal will not be able to prepare his defenses sufficiently. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[But Zebul said to him deceptively]

## Judges 9:37 (#1) (id: 777701)

**"people {are} coming down"**

Here the expression **coming down** is plural, even though the subject, **people**, is singular. In the previous verse, with the same subject, “coming down” was singular. This suggests that Gaal was speaking of a single group of people in the previous verse and that here he is using **people** in a collective sense to mean several groups of people. He is now able to distinguish the separate companies, as Abimelek’s troops get closer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you may wish to reflect this distinction in your translation. The UST models one way to do that.

Here, the term could mean: (1\) that the **lords of Shechem** watched as Gaal went out to fight Abimelek. They may have wanted to see whether he could fulfill the boasts he made in [9:29](https://ref.ly/Judg9:29) when he said he wanted to be their ruler. Alternate translation: \[as the lords of Shechem watched] (2\) that Gaal led the **lords of Shechem** and their men into battle. This seems less likely, as the story only describes the people of Shechem going out of the city the next day. Alternate translation: \[as the commander of the lords of Shechem and their men]

**"and sowed it {with} salt"**

The author is speaking as if Abimelek literally took **salt** and **sowed** it as seed that would grow up from the ground.

Scattering salt all over the ruins of Shechem was a symbolic action. Abimelek did this to express the wish that the city would always be an uninhabited wasteland, like a salt desert.

The author is speaking as if the **evil** that Abimelek did had literally been moving away from him and God **turned** it **back** so that it returned to him and harmed him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[So God made Abimelek experience the same kind of harm he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers]

## Judges 9:57 (#1) (id: 777746)

**"And all of the evil of the men of Shechem, God turned back upon their head"**

The expression **turned back** has the same meaning here as in the previous verse, except that the author speaks more fully of the **evil** that the **men of Shechem** did as if God literally made it come back and land **upon their head**. While he is using one part of them, their **head**, to represent all of them, this expression is especially apt in light of the story, in which Abimelek dies when a heavy stone lands on his head. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[And God also made the people of Shechem experience painfully the same kind of harm that they had done to other people]

**"the men of Shechem"**

Here the masculine term **men** seems to have a generic sense. The author specifies in [9:49](https://ref.ly/Judg9:49) that both “men and women” died when the tower of Shechem burned, so this summary reference to that punishment would include both men and women. Alternate translation: \[the people of Shechem]

## Judges - Chapter 10 Introduction (id: 777751)

Judges 10 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter introduces the account of Jephthah, which continues in Chapters 11 and 12\.

### Literary devices that point to structure

Possessive forms

Within the list of people groups in [10:6](https://ref.ly/Judg10:6), the author uses slightly different possessive forms to make a distinction that is significant for what happens as the book continues. He uses the name of a country or city to speak of the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab. But he describes the inhabitants of a country or cities when he speaks of the gods of “the sons of Ammon” and “the Philistines.” This is because, as the next verse indicates, it was the Ammonites and the Philistines who next conquered and oppressed the Israelites and whom the next two judges opposed. Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, as chapters 11 and 12 describe, and Samson fought against the Philistines, as chapters 13–16 describe. If possible, use slightly different possessive forms in your own translation to reflect this distinction. The UST models one way to do this.

Order of information

In [10:7](https://ref.ly/Judg10:7), the author presents new information in a particular order for a specific reason. In the book, he relates the oppression by the Ammonites and the deliverance by Jephthah in chapters 10–12, before he describes the oppression by the Philistines and the resistance of Samson in chapters 13–16\. But in this verse he is creating a special arrangement between the phrase “into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the sons of Ammon” and those next sections of the book. This arrangement is known as a chiasm. In it, the first and last parts match and the middle parts match. In other words, the author is creating this arrangement: Philistines—Ammonites (this phrase); Ammonites—Philistines (the next sections of the book). However, if it would better help your readers to recognize how this phrase introduces the following accounts of Jephthah and Samson, you could name these people groups in the order in which they feature in the narrative. You might say, in other words, “into the hand of the sons of Ammon and into the hand of the Philistines”

**"And they shattered and crushed the sons of Israel in that year. {For} 18 years, all the sons of Israel who {were} on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which {is} in Gilead"**

The author is describing one event before describing an event that preceded it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. The UST models one way to do this.

## Judges 10:8 (#2) (id: 777771)

**"And they shattered and crushed the sons of Israel in that year"**

The author is using the phrase **in that year** to mean implicitly that the Ammonites began to oppress all of the Israelites, not just the ones living east of the Jordan, as soon as Yahweh decided in his anger to punish and discipline the Israelites. If you decide to relate the events in this verse in the same order that the author does, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation.

## Judges 10:8 (#4) (id: 777773)

**"And they shattered and crushed"**

The author is speaking as if the Israelites had literally been an object such as a clay jar that could be **shattered** or a skull that could be **crushed**. (The author uses the same verb for “crush” in [9:53](https://ref.ly/Judg9:53) to describe what the millstone did to Abimelek’s skull.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[And they afflicted and oppressed]

## Judges 10:8 (#5) (id: 777774)

**"And they shattered and crushed"**

The terms **shattered** and **crushed** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[And they severely oppressed]

## Judges 10:8 (#6) (id: 777775)

**"For} 18 years, all the sons of Israel who {were} on the other side of the Jordan"**

The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: \[For the previous 18 years, they had oppressed all the sons of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan]

**"were} on the other side of the Jordan"**

The author is speaking from a vantage point west of the Jordan River, so **the other side** implicitly means the east side. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[were on the east side of the Jordan]

**"in the land of the Amorites"**

## Judges 10:9 (#1) (id: 777779)

**"and with the house of Ephraim"**

The author is using the word **house** to mean all the people descended from a particular person. So by **the house of Ephraim**, he means all the people descended from Ephraim, who was one of the twelve sons of Jacob. It is not clear why he uses this expression for this tribe but not for the other two tribes he mentions. In your translation, you could speak of **Ephraim** the same way the author speaks of **Judah** and **Benjamin**. Alternate translation: \[and with Ephraim]

In this verse and the next verse, Yahweh is asking the Israelites a long question, using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. In order to do that, you could create a verse bridge for verses 11–12\. Alternate translation: \[When the Egyptians and Amorites and Ammonites and Philistines and Sidonians and Amalekites and Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to me, and I saved you from their hand!]

**"Go and cry out to the gods upon whom you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress"**

Yahweh does not really want the Israelites to **cry out** to other **gods** for help. He means to communicate emphatically the opposite of the literal meaning of his words.

## Judges 10:18 (#3) (id: 777797)

**"Who {is} the man who will begin to fight with the sons of Ammon"**

The leaders of Gilead are using a common expression to ask who should lead their army against the Ammonites. They are not asking which soldier will be the first to engage in combat with them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[Who will lead our army to fight against the Ammonites?]

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Why did Jephthah sacrifice his daughter?

The story of Jephthah defeating the Ammonites has a tragic ending. He vows that if Yahweh will give him victory, upon his return, he will sacrifice the first person who comes out of his house as a burnt offering. This person turns out to be his daughter, his only child. But he fulfills his vow anyway and sacrifices her. Part of the explanation for this is that Jephthah’s half\-brothers drove him away from their home in Israel so that he had to live in Syria. The Syrians practiced human sacrifice, and Jephthah apparently came to regard it as a way of influencing a deity. The rest of the explanation is that Jephthah did not know the provisions of the law of Moses. In [Leviticus 27:1–8](https://ref.ly/Lev27:1-Lev27:8), Yahweh tells Moses that if someone dedicates a person, he must redeem that person by paying a certain amount of silver shekels. That is what Jephthah was supposed to do. It was all right for him to devote a family member to Yahweh as long as he then redeemed that person. The author of Judges is using this story to show what happens when, as he says in [17:6](https://ref.ly/Judg17:6) and [21:25](https://ref.ly/Judg21:25), everyone does what is right in his own eyes, rather than what Yahweh has commanded. This supports the overall argument of the book that Israel should have a good king who makes sure that the Israelites follow the law of Moses.

**"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a warrior of valor, but he {was} the son of a whoring woman. Now Gilead had begotten Jephthah"**

Here and in the next two verses, the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

## Judges 11:1 (#2) (id: 777801)

**"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a warrior of valor"**

The author is using introducing **Jephthah** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: \[Now there was a man named Jephthah, a Gileadite, who was a warrior of valor]

## Judges 11:2 (#1) (id: 777804)

**"And the wife of Gilead bore sons to him"**

The author does not say specifically whether Gilead became the father of Jephthah before or after he was married. However, the story seems to suggest that it was before and that Jephthah was somewhat older than his half\-brothers, since they had to wait until they grew up to drive him away from the family. Your language may have a connecting phrase that you can use to indicate this. Alternate translation: \[Later, when Gilead had a wife, she bore sons to him]

## Judges 11:2 (#2) (id: 777805)

**"and they drove out Jephthah and said to him, “You will not inherit in the house of our father, for you are the son of another woman"**

Since the **sons of the wife** said this to Jephthah before they **drove** him **out**, in your translation you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: \[and they said to Jephthah, “You will not inherit in the house of our father, for you are the son of another woman.” And they drove him out]

**"in the house of our father"**

## Judges 11:2 (#4) (id: 777807)

**"in the house of our father"**

Gilead was the father of Jephthah and his half\-brothers, so it may be natural for you to use the inclusive form of **our** if your language marks that distinction. However, since the half\-brothers are describing **the house of our father** to Jephthah as something that he has no place in, some languages, considering the entire phrase, might use the exclusive form.

The author is using this phrase to return to the main story after providing background information about Jephthah. This is the same event that was described in [10:17](https://ref.ly/Judg10:17). Alternate translation: \[It was some days after that when the sons of Ammon fought with Israel]

**"Do you not hate me, since you drove me from the house of my father"**

Jephthah is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: \[It is clear that hate me, since you drove me from the house of my father!]

**"Do you not hate me, since you drove me from the house of my father"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: \[You drove me from the house of my father, and that shows that you hate me!]

**"since you drove me from the house of my father"**

It was Jephthah’s half\-brothers, not the elders of Gilead, who drove him from the house of his father. Jephthah may mean that the elders were implicated in this action because they did nothing to help him. Alternate translation: \[since you did nothing to help me when my brothers drove me from the house of my father]

## Judges 11:8 (#1) (id: 777821)

**"Therefore we have now returned to you"**

The elders are using the word translated as **Therefore** to acknowledge the reason why they have **returned** to Jephthah to ask for his help. They do not mean that they have come because they hate Jephthah or because they drove him out. They mean that they have come because they have trouble. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: \[Yes, it is because we are in trouble that we have returned to you]

**"So you shall come with us and fight with the sons of Ammon, and you shall be for us the head of all of the dwellers of Gilead"**

**"If you have brought me back to fight with the sons of Ammon and Yahweh gives them over to my face, I will be the head for you"**

This could mean: (1\) that Jephthah is restating the condition that the elders described in order to confirm it. Your language may have an expression that you can use to indicate this. Alternate translation: \[Now let me get this straight: If you have brought me back to fight with the sons of Ammon and Yahweh gives them over to my face, I will be the head for you] (2\) that Jephthah is asking the elders to confirm the description they have described.

## Judges 11:12 (#1) (id: 777835)

**"What to me and to you, that you have come against me to fight in my land"**

Jephthah’s messengers are speaking on his behalf, and so they use the singular pronouns **me** and **my**. They are addressing the Ammonite king, so **you** is also singular. However, Jephthah is speaking as a representative of all the Israelites, and he is addressing the Ammonite king as a representative of his own people and army. So it may be more natural in your language to use the plural pronouns “us” and “our” and plural forms of **you** if your language marks that distinction.

**"and said"**

The verb **said** is singular. It refers to Jephthah, and it means that Jephthah said this to the king of Ammon through his messengers. However, since a group of messengers actually spoke these words to the king, it might be more natural in your language to use the pronoun “they” with a plural verb.

**"Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the sons of Ammon"**

Jephthah recognizes that the Ammonite king is speaking of land that formerly belonged partly to Ammon and partly to Moab. It appears that at this time, the Moabites were either allies or subjects of the Ammonites, and so the Ammonite king regards the Moabites’ interests as his own. The author assumes that his readers will have this knowledge and so he does not explain it as background information. But you could indicate it in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[Israel did not take any land from you Ammonites or from your allies the Moabites]

**"in their coming up"** \- **"and he came"**

The messengers are using both plural (**their**) and singular (**he**) pronouns to refer to **Israel**, as a group of people and as a nation. It may be more natural in your language to use either plural or singular pronouns consistently. Alternate translation: \[when they came up … and they came] or \[when he came up … and he came]

Jephthah’s messengers are using the term **border** by association to refer to all of Sihon’s territory. However, it is significant that they do not say “land,” as they report the Israelite messengers saying in the previous verse. The idea is that not only did Sihon not want the Israelites to walk across his land, he did not want them even to cross the border and come into any part of his territory. Alternate translation: \[coming into his territory]

So it would be good to include this information. However, it may be clearer in your language to introduce it with a word other than **And** in order to show that this sentence is not saying something additional to the last sentence of the previous verse. It is repeating the meaning, although with further information. Alternate translation: \[Indeed, they possessed]

If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis.

**"did he fight with them"**

The messengers are leaving some information implicit that they know the Ammonite king will understand. Most modern readers, however, will not have this information. It is that the land that the Israelites acquired when they defeated Sihon had previously belonged to the Moabites and Ammonites. Sihon had taken it from them. But Balak did not try to get it back. The implication is that unless the Ammonite king thinks that he is greater than Balak, he should not try to get it back either. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[did he fight with them to get back the part of that land that Sihon had earlier taken from the Moabites and Ammonites? No, and you should not either!]

**"according to what came forth from your mouth"**

## Judges 11:36 (#3) (id: 777896)

**"vengeances"**

Jephthah’s daughter is using the plural form **vengeances** in a context where the singular term “vengeance” would suffice. This suggests that she is using the plural form for emphasis.

The town of Mizpah was located at a high elevation, and Jephthah’s daughter is indicating that she would like to go down from there and wander the hills in the area. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[and I will wander the hills in this area]

Judges 13 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins the account of Samson, which continues through Chapter 16\.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Warning not to cut Samson’s hair

The angel of Yahweh gave Samson’s parents special instructions about how they were to raise the boy they would have. They were to make a Nazarite vow, a special type of vow dedicating Samson to Yahweh. Part of this vow prohibited cutting the person’s hair. The person also could not drink beer or wine or even eat grapes. Samson’s mother was to observe those prohibitions even while she was pregnant, since anything she ate or drank would also nourish the baby in her womb. (See: Nazirite and vow)

Translation Issues in This Chapter

### The angel of Yahweh

A character whom the author calls “the angel of Yahweh” figures prominently in this chapter. See the discussion of this phrase in the General Introduction to Judges, and see how you translated the phrase “the angel of Yahweh” in Chapters 2, 5, and 6\.

Judges 14 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

The story of Samson continues in this chapter.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:14 and 14:18\.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Why did Samson’s parents not want him to marry a Philistine woman?

The law of Moses forbade Israelites to marry a Canaanite or anyone from a different people group. This is why Samson’s parents did not want him to marry a Philistine woman.

### How could Samson do such great feats of strength?

The author says of Samson in 14:6 and 14:19 that “the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him.” This means that Yahweh gave Samson extraordinary strength. Samson’s power was the power of Yahweh himself. He was an agent of Yahweh’s judgment against the Philistines.

* **Associated Passages:** JDG 14:1

## Judges 14:1 (#1) (id: 777981)

**"from the daughters of the Philistines"**

This expression is similar to the common use in this culture of the term “sons” to mean the members of a people group, but here it seems to have a more specific meaning. Alternate translation: \[among the Philistine young women]

**"Is there} not among the daughters of your brothers and among all of my people a woman, that you {are} going to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines"**

In this culture, people would speak of a woman who was engaged to a man as his **wife**, and they would speak of a man who was engaged to a woman as her **husband**, even before the two were yet married. Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: \[to the fiancée of Samson … your fiancé]

**"we burn you and the house of your father with fire"**

**"And the wife of Samson wept on him"**

While it is likely that Samson’s **wife** may have literally **wept on him**, throwing herself on him, sobbing, so that her tears fell on him, this expression is speaking of her weeping as if it had literally been a burden that was heavy and wearying for Samson to carry.

Since the author says in [14:15](https://ref.ly/Judg14:15) that it was only on the “seventh day” of the feast that the Philistine young men came to Samson’s bride and threatened her, he is apparently using the whole period here, **seven days**, to represent the time that remained in that period.

**"and the ropes that {were} on his arms became like flax that they burn with fire"**

The point of this comparison is that just as **flax** breaks easily when people **burn** it with **fire**, so the ropes on Samson’s arms broke easily.

The ULT has spelled out this name using English letters so that readers will know how it sounds. However, it means “The Throwing of the Jawbone”; the author is explaining how the place got its name. In your translation, you could spell this name the way it sounds in your language but then add an explanation of its meaning. Alternate translation: \[Ramath Lehi, which means “The Throwing of the Jawbone”]

The account of Samson concludes in this chapter.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Why did Samson wear his hair long in seven locks?

In 16:13, Samson speaks of the “seven locks of my head,” meaning the seven braids of his long hair. In Numbers 6:5, the law of Moses forbade Nazirites to cut their hair. Samson kept his hair long because he was a Nazirite. The law of Moses did not specify that Nazirites needed to wear their hair in seven locks or braids. But Samson was doing that as a symbolic action that represented his dedication to God. The number seven symbolized completeness, so the seven braids could have represented the perfection of God or the complete devotion that the Nazirite vow entailed. However, it would not be appropriate to explain the significance of this action in your translation by having Samson say something such as “the seven braids that show I am dedicated to God.” That is the secret that Samson is trying to keep from Delilah. Though he eventually divulges it, he does not do so when he first mentions the seven braids of his hair. But you might put something about this in a footnote if that would be helpful for your readers.

## Judges 16:1 (#1) (id: 778077)

**"and he went in to her"**

The author is speaking in a polite way about a private matter. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation or you could express the meaning plainly as in the UST. Alternate translation: \[and he had sexual relations with her]

## Judges 16:2 (#1) (id: 778078)

**"And it was told} to the Gazites, saying"**

Ancient translations of the book of Judges all have the words **And it was told.** The text does not make sense without them. So it appears that these words dropped out of the Hebrew text during the process of copying and transmission. Modern versions of the Bible include them or the equivalent, and we recommend that you do the same in your translation. If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: \[And the Gazites learned]

**"So they encircled"**

## Judges 16:4 (#2) (id: 778082)

**"he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, and her name {was} Delilah"**

**"1,100 silver"**

It is not clear why the Philistine lords offer to give Delilah 1,100 silver pieces each. Usually people offer a large, round number such as 1,000\. Some interpreters suggest that in this culture, adding 100 to a number was a way of specifying exactly that amount and no less. See the similar instance in [20:35](https://ref.ly/Judg20:35).

**"just as a string of flax is broken in its touching fire"**

The point of this comparison is that just as **fire** has no difficulty causing a string made of flax to break, so Samson remained strong enough to break the cords very easily. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: \[as easily as a string of flax breaks when it touches fire]

Samson is repeating forms of the verb **bind** in order to intensify the idea that he is expressing.

**"and she shaved"**

Since the author says that Delilah **called to a man**, it appears that he was the one who **shaved** Samson’s hair while she held him quietly on her knees. So the author is using one person who was involved in the process of shaving Samson’s hair, Delilah, to represent everyone who was involved. But since the man himself apparently did the shaving, it may be more natural in your language to use a pronoun here that represents him. Alternate translation: \[and he shaved]

## Judges - Chapter 17 Introduction (id: 778143)

Judges 17 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins the final section of the book of Judges. In this section, the author describes the atrocities and chaos that characterized the nation in the absence of a godly leader. Many of the judges had been godly leaders who made sure that the people of Israel obeyed Yahweh. But since they were all individuals whom God raised up at specific times, there was not a continuity of godly leadership. As the author says earlier in the book, “when Yahweh raised up for them judges, then Yahweh was with the judge and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all of the days of the judge. … But it happened, at the death of the judge, they turned and acted corruptly more than their fathers, to walk after other gods, to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not drop {any} of their deeds or {any} of their stubborn ways” (2:18–19\). So in this section, the author is showing how important and helpful it would have been to have a continuity of godly leadership such as a line of good kings would provide. A godly leader would guide the people in the true worship of Yahweh and ensure justice and righteousness. This was fulfilled partially by David, and it has now been fulfilled definitively by God’s Messianic king, Jesus.

In this chapter and the next one, the author describes how idolatry took root in Israel, in the additional territory that the tribe of Dan conquered for itself.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Idols and figures

The law of Moses forbade the Israelites to make any idols. While the instructions Yahweh gave Moses for the tabernacle included making metal figures, the Israelites were not to make any figures that represented gods that they would worship. This practice was common in Canaan, and it shows the influence the Israelites allowed these people to have on them. Micah’s mother should not have had an image made out of silver, and Micah should not have set it up as an idol and gotten a priest to serve at the shrine where he put it. (See: idol)

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “an idol and a cast image”

The author speaks of what Micah’s mother had a refiner make from her silver as “an idol and a cast image.” Some interpreters understand this to be two things, while other interpreters understand it to be one thing. Like many languages, Hebrew sometimes expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” If that is what the author is doing here, he means that this was a cast image that served as an idol. In 18:20, he speaks simply of “the idol” apparently to mean the same thing as “an idol and a molded image” in 18:14\. That suggests that the phrase “an idol and a cast image” does mean a cast image that served as an idol or an idol that was made by casting an image. In your translation, you may wish to use a phrase such as “a molded idol” as the UST does. (See: Hendiadys)

**"Consecrating, I consecrate the silver to Yahweh"**

The mother is repeating forms of the verb **consecrate** in order to intensify her expression of the idea that it conveys.

While the author does not say specifically that it was not right for the tribe of Dan to kill all the inhabitants of the city of Laish and take their territory, he indicates this implicitly. He notes that they were Sidonians, not Canaanites such as Yahweh had told the Israelites to drive out, and that they were living peacefully, not posing any threat. The Israelites had been given exceptional instructions to kill all of the Canaanites. Most interpreters believe that this was so that the Canaanites would not influence the Israelites to follow their practices, which were very wicked and destructive. But Yahweh did not tell the Israelites to kill all the people from other groups. So readers are meant to understand implicitly that the soldiers from Dan committed an atrocity against the people of Laish. The author is presenting this as evidence that if Israel had a godly king, he would maintain order and justice throughout the land, protect vulnerable people, and lead Israel away from idolatry and toward proper worship and obedience of Yahweh.

**"Is} the good"**

The men are using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean what would be better. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

## Judges - Chapter 19 Introduction (id: 778266)

Judges 19 General Notes
=======================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, the author begins to tell a story that provides further evidence of the benefits of Israel having a godly king. He describes an outrageous crime that Israelite men in the city of Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin committed against a helpless person.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Why did the Levite push his concubine out to the mob?

This chapter describes how a mob of men in the city of Gibeah wanted to rape a Levite man who was staying in the city overnight. While the men were going to use sex as a weapon, what they intended was ultimately a crime of power and violence. The Levite believed they were going to kill him (see 20:5\). So to save his own life, he pushed his concubine out to the mob, and they raped and killed her. The author describes this crime as further evidence that Israel needed a godly king who would maintain order and justice and protect vulnerable people. The author is not presenting what the Levite did, or what his host offered to do (surrendering his daughter and the Levite’s concubine to the mob), as exemplary. The Bible is not saying through this story that a sexual crime against a woman is not as bad as a sexual crime against a man. It is not saying that men may or should sacrifice family members in order to save their own lives. The example that the Bible presents for us to imitate is that of Jesus, who sacrificed himself in order to save others.

### Why did the Levite cut up the dead body of his concubine?

The author describes in 19:29 how the Levite brought the body of his murdered concubine home and cut it into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the land of Israel. He probably had messengers carry pieces through the territory of each of the twelve tribes and explain what had happened. Cutting the woman’s body into twelve pieces was a symbolic action that called for collective vengeance by all twelve tribes of Israel. The implicit message was that this outrageous crime had defiled the entire land and that the Israelites corporately had a responsibility to cleanse the land by executing justice on the perpetrators. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation. You might say, for example, “and he cut her body into twelve pieces, one to send to each tribe of Israel to call for collective vengeance.”

## Judges 19:1 (#1) (id: 778267)

## Judges 19:2 (#1) (id: 778271)

**"But"** \- **"whored against him"**

The expression that the ULT translates as **whored against him** could also mean that the man’s concubine became angry with him because of something that he did. Many versions translate it that way. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

## Judges 19:4 (#2) (id: 778275)

**"And they ate and they drank and they lodged there"**

While the pronoun **they** probably refers in its first two instances to the Levite, his concubine, his servant, and his father\-in\-law, in the third instance, it may not include the father\-in\-law. Since he already lived in the house, the author may not be saying that he was among those who **lodged** or stayed overnight there. Your language might naturally indicate this distinction in some way.

## Judges 19:18 (#2) (id: 778301)

**"and I {am} going {to} the house of Yahweh"**

The author assumes that readers will infer that the Levite had made a vow to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh at the tabernacle if he was successful in bringing back his concubine. So while the Levite says that ultimately he is heading back home to the **hill country of Ephraim**, he is indicating that he will be going to Shiloh first. (He may be saying this in case the old man is God\-fearing and this would be an additional incentive for him to provide hospitality.) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[and before returning home I will be going to the tabernacle to offer a thanksgiving sacrifice]

**"But there is even straw and even fodder for our donkeys, and there is even bread and wine for me and for your maidservant and for the young man with your servants. {There is} no need of anything"**

The Levite is using the courteous language of hospitality. Although he has sat in the open square to show that he needs lodging, he is intentionally understating his needs in order to show that he does not wish to impose too much on this potential host. You may be able to express this in terms of the hospitality conventions of your own language and culture.

## Judges - Chapter 20 Introduction (id: 778333)

Judges 20 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, the author continues the story he began in Chapter 19 which provides evidence of the benefits of Israel having a godly king in the future. He tells how the Benjaminites refused to surrender the men who had committed the outrageous crime and how the Israelites fought a very destructive war against them to purge Israel from the guilt and defilement of this crime.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Why does the Levite say that the “lords of Gibeah” encircled the house?

As the Levite is giving an account of the crime to the Israelite assembly, he says that “the lords of Gibeah arose against me, and they encircled the house at night against me” (20:5\). He probably does not mean that the legal rulers of the city of Gibeah did this, even though he is using the same term that the author uses for such rulers several times in Chapter 9 when he speaks of the “lords of Shechem.” (The phrase “the lords of the Philistines,” which occurs several times in Chapter 16, uses a different term for “lords,” but it has the same meaning.) Rather, the Levite probably means that the wicked men who surrounded the house where he was staying could do whatever they wanted in the city and no one could stop them. It was as if they actually were the “lords” of the city. The UST models one way to convey this meaning.

### Why does the Levite say that the men of Gibeah intended to “kill” him?

The wicked men in Gibeah shout in 19:22 to those inside the house that they want to “know” the Levite, that is, to assault him sexually. When the Levite gives an account of their crime in 20:5, he says that they intended to kill him. He probably says this because he recognizes that while the men were going to use sex as a weapon, they intended to commit a crime of power and violence that would likely have involved killing him in the end. That is what they did to his concubine. The UST models one way to convey this meaning.

Translation Issues in This Chapter
----------------------------------

### “drawing a sword”

Several times in this chapter, the author describes men as “drawing a sword.” He is using one thing that a skilled fighter would learn to do to represent all the things that such a fighter would do. The meaning is that such men were experienced soldiers. Use a word or phrase in your translation that would convey that meaning. (See: Synecdoche)

**"Then all of the sons of Israel came forth, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan and unto Beersheba and the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah"**

It may be more natural in your language to put the information about where the Israelites came from with the statement that they **came forth**. Alternate translation: \[Then all of the sons of Israel came forth, from Dan and unto Beersheba and the land of Gilead, and the congregation was assembled as one man to Yahweh at Mizpah]

## Judges - Chapter 21 Introduction (id: 778457)

Judges 21 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, the author concludes the story he began in Chapter 19 by showing the benefits of Israel having a godly king. He tells how the Israelites realized that they had gone too far in destroying the Benjaminites and how they resorted to further violence and deceit in order to provide wives for the surviving Benjaminites so that they could continue their family lines. The implied information in 21:5 is that the Israelites thought that if they killed all the people of that city except its young women, they could give them as wives to the surviving men from the tribe of Benjamin.

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### Sin and immorality

At the end of Judges, there is much sin and immorality. The people are doing wrong and are trying to fix their wrongs by doing more evil things. The period of the Judges is typified by this final account and summarized by the author’s closing statement, “A man did the right in his eyes” (ULT), which means that “everyone did what they thought they should do” (UST). The book of Judges ends this way in order to lead into the following part of the biblical narrative, which describes how God chose David to be a godly king of the Israelite people.

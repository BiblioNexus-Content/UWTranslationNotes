In the second clause, he uses the word <strong>blessings</strong> to show the Corinthians how to apply what he says about farmers to the collection. Just as farmers receive a harvest that fits with how they sowed, so people who give to help other believers will receive <strong>blessings</strong> that fit with what and how much they gave. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or clearly express how the metaphor relates to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “giving money to help other believers is like farming. The one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings” or “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing generously will also reap generously.

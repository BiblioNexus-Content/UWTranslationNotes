## Ezra - Introduction (id: 718613)

Introduction to Ezra
====================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of Ezra

1. The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1–2:70\)
2. The people rebuild and dedicate the temple in Jerusalem (3:1–6:22\)
3. More exiles return; Ezra teaches the Law of Yahweh (7:1–8:36\)
4. The problem of the people marrying foreigners, and how it is solved (9:1–10:44\)

### What is the Book of Ezra about?

The book of Ezra is about how the people of Israel returned from Babylon and tried to worship Yahweh again as the law required. To do this, they needed to rebuild their temple so that they could sacrifice to Yahweh. (See: Temple)

### How should the title of this book be translated?

The book of Ezra is named for the priest Ezra who led the first group of Jews out of exile and back to Judah. Translators can use the traditional title “Ezra.” Or they might choose a clearer title, such as “The Book about Ezra.”

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?

Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners because he knew that this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: False God)

### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?

Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the land of Israel. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### How does the Book of Ezra use the term “Israel”?

The book of Ezra uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: Israel)

### Are the events in the Book of Ezra told in the order that they actually happened?

Some of the events in the Book of Ezra are not told in the order that they happened, but are grouped according to theme. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of chronological order.

## Ezra - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 718614)

Ezra 1 General Notes
====================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

The chapter records the story of the first Jews as they return from Persia to Judea.

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### King Cyrus

King Cyrus allowed the Jews to return because he wanted them to rebuild the temple. Those who stayed behind gave gifts to those who left to help them on their journey and resettlement. This practice was common under the reign of Cyrus and was used as a way to maintain peace throughout his kingdom. (See: Temple)

Possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------

### Jews

After they returned to Judea, the focus of the rest of the Old Testament is on the Jewish people.

* **Associated Articles:** Temple (ID: 27142)

## Ezra 1:1 (#1) (id: 462462)

**"Now in year"**

The word **now** introduces a new event in the story. Use the normal method for introducing the beginning of a true story in your language.

See: Introduction of a New Event

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Ezra 1:1 (#2) (id: 462463)

**"Now in year one of Cyrus, the king of Persia"**

The original Jewish readers of this book would have known that this is not a reference to the year when Cyrus first became king of the Persians. Rather, it is a reference to the later year when, by conquering Babylon, he became king over the Jews, since Babylon is the nation that had previously conquered the Jews and taken them into exile. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “During the first year after Cyrus, the king of Persia, conquered Babylon and became ruler over the Jews”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Ezra 1:1 (#3) (id: 462464)

**"Now in year one of Cyrus, the king of Persia"**

This expression could mean that sometime during the first year that he ruled over the Jews, Cyrus issued the decree that this verse describes. However, it could also mean that he issued this decree as soon as he became their ruler. Alternate translation: “As soon as Cyrus, the king of Persia, conquered Babylon and became the ruler of the Jews”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1

## Ezra 1:1 (#4) (id: 462465)

**"Now in year one"**

The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, **one**, but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “In the first year”

See: Ordinal Numbers

* **Associated Articles:** Ordinal Numbers (ID: 33393)

## Ezra 1:1 (#5) (id: 462466)

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Ezra 1:1 (#8) (id: 462469)

**"the word of Yahweh"**

What Yahweh had said specifically was that, after 70 years in exile, the Jews would be allowed to return to their homeland. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, or you could put this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the promise that Yahweh had made that after 70 years in exile, the Jews would be allowed to return to their homeland”

## Ezra 1:1 (#9) (id: 462470)

**"Yahweh"**

**Yahweh** is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. It occurs many times in the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.

See: How to Translate Names

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Ezra 1:1 (#10) (id: 462471)

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Ezra 1:1 (#11) (id: 462472)

**"Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus"**

Here the book uses one aspect of Cyrus, his spirit, to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “Yahweh put a desire to do something into Cyrus”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: 33315)

## Ezra 1:1 (#12) (id: 462473)

**"Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus"**

Here, the book speaks of Yahweh causing Cyrus to act by saying that he **stirred up** his spirit in the way that winds might stir up calm waters and make them move around. The meaning is that Yahweh directly influenced the heart and will of Cyrus to get him to do something. Alternate translation: “Yahweh put a desire to do something into Cyrus”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 1:1 (#13) (id: 462474)

**"So he caused"** \- **"to pass"**

The word **so** indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result, he made … to be sent”

See: Connect — Reason\-and\-Result Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship (ID: 33331)

## Ezra 1:1 (#14) (id: 462475)

**"So he caused a sound to pass throughout all his kingdom"**

Here, **he** means Cyrus. In this context, the **sound** is a voice speaking a message, and the voice represents the message that it speaks. But since the message could not travel by itself, ultimately the reference is to the messengers who delivered it. Alternate translation: “Cyrus sent messengers out to proclaim a decree everywhere in his empire”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Ezra 1:1 (#15) (id: 462476)

**"and also in writing"**

Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning is: Cyrus also put this decree in writing. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and Cyrus also sent out written copies of the decree” or “and Cyrus also had his scribes write down the decree in his official records”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: 33267)

## Ezra 1:2 (#1) (id: 462477)

**"Yahweh, the God of heaven"**

Here Cyrus provides some background information to inform his subjects who Yahweh is. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God who is above all” or “Yahweh, the God who rules in heaven”

See: Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding (ID: 33264)

## Ezra 1:2 (#2) (id: 462478)

**"all the kingdoms of the earth"**

**All** is an exaggeration for emphasis. There were still some kingdoms on earth that Cyrus did not rule. However, he had conquered every other large empire in his part of the world that might have been a threat to him. Alternate translation: “to be unchallenged ruler over this entire land”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: 33281)

## Ezra 1:2 (#3) (id: 462479)

**"has given to me"**

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “has made me the king over”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:2 (#4) (id: 462480)

**"to build for him a house"**

Cyrus is not going to do the building personally. Rather, he means that he is giving the Jews, the people who worship Yahweh, permission and support to rebuild his temple, which the Babylonians had destroyed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to make it possible for the Jews, the people who worship him, to rebuild his temple”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Ezra 1:2 (#5) (id: 462481)

**"a house"**

Here, **house** means a temple. Cyrus speaks of this temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. Alternate translation: “a temple”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 1:2 (#6) (id: 462482)

**"in Jerusalem, which is in Judah"**

Here, Cyrus provides some background information about the city where he wants the Jews to rebuild the temple of Yahweh, since many of the recipients of his message might not have known where Jerusalem was. Alternate translation: “in Jerusalem, the capital city of the province of Judah”

See: Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding (ID: 33264)

## Ezra 1:2 (#7) (id: 462483)

**"in Jerusalem, which is in Judah"**

**Jerusalem** is the name of a city, and **Judah** is the name of the province in which it was located. These names occur many times in the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate them consistently each time.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Ezra 1:3 (#1) (id: 462484)

**"Whoever among you is from all his people"**

Here, **all** probably indicates that Cyrus is thinking of not only the people whom the Babylonians had taken into exile from the southern kingdom of Judah some decades before, and their descendants, but also any of the people whose ancestors the Assyrians had taken into exile from the northern kingdom of Israel nearly two centuries earlier. Cyrus now ruled over the territories to which both groups had been exiled. If any in the second group still had awareness and proof of their identity, and if they still wanted to honor and worship Yahweh, they could also return to Jerusalem and help rebuild the temple. (However, as [1:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:5) indicates, it was essentially Israelites from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin who actually did return.) To make this clear, you could include this information. Alternate translation: “Which of you is an Israelite from any tribe”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Ezra 1:3 (#2) (id: 462485)

**"may his God be with him"**

Cyrus wishing that **God** will **be with** these Israelites is an idiom that expresses his wish that God would make their journey and the rebuilding project successful. If it is more natural in your language, you could say this at the end of the verse. Alternate translation: “May his God make him successful”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:3 (#3) (id: 462486)

**"and may he go up to Jerusalem"**

Cyrus says **go up** because the Jews would have to travel from a river valley up into the mountains in order to return from their places of exile to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “and let him return to Jerusalem”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:3 (#4) (id: 462487)

**"to Jerusalem, which is in Judah"**

Cyrus once again provides background information about the city. Alternate translation: “to Jerusalem, in the province of Judah”

See: Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding (ID: 33264)

## Ezra 1:3 (#5) (id: 462488)

**"the house of Yahweh"**

Here, **house** means a temple. Cyrus continues to speak of this temple as if it would be a house in which Yahweh lived, since Yahweh’s presence would be there. Alternate translation: “a temple for Yahweh”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 1:3 (#6) (id: 462489)

**"Yahweh, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem"**

Here Cyrus provides further background information to inform his subjects who Yahweh is. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God whom the people of Israel worship, who should have a temple in Jerusalem”

See: Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Distinguishing Versus Informing or Reminding (ID: 33264)

## Ezra 1:3 (#7) (id: 462490)

**"the God of Israel"**

The phrase **the God of Israel** does not mean that God belongs to Israel, but that this is the God whom Israel worships. Alternate translation: “the God whom Israel worships”

See: Possession

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Possession (ID: 33303)

## Ezra 1:4 (#1) (id: 462491)

**"And every one who is remaining in all of the places where he is sojourning there, let the men of his place lift him"**

The structure of this sentence may present difficulties for translation because the long phrase at the beginning actually describes who will receive the action, rather than who will do the action. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say first who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Let the people who live in any place where Jewish survivors are in exile help them”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4

## Ezra 1:4 (#2) (id: 462492)

**"And every one who is remaining"**

This phrase refers to any Israelite who is a surviving member of the group that was taken into exile, or who is a descendant of someone in that group. The word **remaining** refers to people who are remaining or left over from a larger group. In this context, that larger group is all of the Israelites who lived in the land of Judah before the Babylonians conquered it. Alternate translation: “Any survivor of the Jews who were taken from their land”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:4 (#3) (id: 462493)

**"in all of the places where he is sojourning there"**

**Sojourning** means living somewhere other than in one’s native land. Here, **he** refers to any Jew such as is described in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “in any of the places where a Jew may be living in exile”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:4 (#4) (id: 462494)

**"where he is sojourning there"**

Saying **where** and **there** in the same phrase like this is a characteristic Hebrew construction, but it might represent an unnecessary duplication in your language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could omit any translation of the word “there.” Alternate translation: “in which he is living”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4

## Ezra 1:4 (#5) (id: 462495)

**"let the men of his place lift him"**

It is likely that both women and men would have helped to gather the supplies listed in the rest of this verse to support the returning Jews. So the term **men** here probably includes both groups. Alternate translation: “the people of that place should help him”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: 33276)

## Ezra 1:4 (#6) (id: 462496)

**"let"** \- **"lift him"**

**Lift** here is an idiom that means help. Alternate translation: “let … help him by providing him”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:4 (#7) (id: 462497)

**"the freewill offering"**

The book expects readers to know that these would be extra gifts, beyond the necessities already listed. They might include money to help rebuild the temple and vessels to be used in the temple, such as the ones listed in [1:7–11](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:7-Ezra1:11). Alternate translation: “any extra gifts that they want to give”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Ezra 1:4 (#8) (id: 462498)

**"for the house of God, which is in Jerusalem"**

**House** means a temple. Cyrus continues to speak of this temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. The book repeatedly uses the expressions **house**, **house of God**, and “house of Yahweh” to mean the temple in Jerusalem. It will be helpful to your readers if you translate these expressions consistently every time. Alternate translation: “for the temple that the Jews will rebuild for God in Jerusalem”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 1:5 (#1) (id: 462499)

**"Then"** \- **"arose"**

The word **then** indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous verses have described. Alternate translation: “In response to this decree … prepared”

See: Connect — Reason\-and\-Result Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship (ID: 33331)

## Ezra 1:5 (#2) (id: 462500)

**"Then"** \- **"arose"**

In this context, the term **arose** means that these leaders took action to get an enterprise under way. It does not indicate that these leaders had been sitting or lying down and that they stood up. Alternate translation: “Then … started making preparations”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:5 (#3) (id: 462501)

**"the heads of the fathers"**

This is an abbreviated way of saying the heads of the father’s houses. Alternate translation: “the clan leaders”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: 33267)

## Ezra 1:5 (#4) (id: 462502)

**"the heads of the fathers"**

Among the Israelites, the expression “father’s house” or “house of the father” originally described an extended\-family group. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. In this expression, the word “house” (which does not appear in the abbreviated version here) describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “the clan leaders”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:5

## Ezra 1:5 (#5) (id: 462503)

**"the heads of"**

Here, **heads** is a figurative way of saying leaders. Alternate translation: “leaders”

## Ezra 1:5 (#7) (id: 462505)

**"that is, all whose spirit God had stirred up"**

Here the book again speaks of God causing people to act by saying that he **stirred up** their spirits the way winds might stir up calm waters and get them to move around. The meaning is that God directly influenced the hearts and wills of these clan leaders to get them to do something. Alternate translation: “all those whom God had led to act”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 1:5 (#8) (id: 462506)

**"to go up"**

As in [1:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:3), the book says **go up** because the Jews would have to travel from a river valley up into the mountains in order to return from their places of exile to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “to return to Jerusalem”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 1:6 (#1) (id: 462507)

**"And all those around them"**

**All** is an exaggeration for emphasis. Every person who lived near a returning Jew did not necessarily provide support. But the expression indicates that the Jews received very generous support from many of their neighbors. Alternate translation: “And the people of their communities”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: 33281)

## Ezra 1:6 (#2) (id: 462508)

**"strengthened their hands"**

Here, **hands** represents strength and power. This expression means that the neighbors of the Jews gave them greater capacity to act and fulfill their project by supplying them with the items listed. Alternate translation: “enabled them by giving them”

## Ezra 1:7 (#1) (id: 462510)

**"And the king Cyrus brought out"**

**Cyrus** did not do this work himself. He ordered others to do it. If that is not understood in your language, you can say this explicitly, as in the UST.

## Ezra 1:7 (#2) (id: 462511)

**"the vessels of the house of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and had put in the house of his gods"**

**Vessels** refers to the bowls, basins, and other objects that are listed in [1:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:9) and [1:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:10). The book assumes that readers will know that this verse is describing how Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, took these items from the temple in Jerusalem and then put them, as trophies of conquest, in a temple devoted to his own gods. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the objects from the temple of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had taken away from Jerusalem when he captured that city and then put in the temple of his own gods”

## Ezra 1:8 (#1) (id: 462513)

**"And Cyrus, the king of Persia, brought them out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer"**

Here, **by the hand of** is a metaphor that represents control and action. The expression means that Mithredath did this at the command of Cyrus and on his behalf. Mithredath would have commanded others to do the work; he would not have carried the things in his own hands. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus of Persia ordered his treasurer, Mithredath, to bring them out”

The implication is that these vessels had remained in the temple where Nebuchadnezzar had put them, and so **Mithredath brought them out** from there. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Cyrus of Persia had his treasurer, Mithredath, bring these vessels out from the temple where Nebuchadnezzar had put them”

## Ezra 1:8 (#5) (id: 462517)

**"And he counted them out to Sheshbazzar"**

Here, **he** refers to Mithredath, and **them** refers to the objects for the temple. The expression **counted them out** probably does not mean that Mithredath handed Sheshbazzar the objects one at a time while announcing the number of each one. It probably means that Mithredath gave Sheshbazzar the objects along with a document that listed how many there were of each kind, as recorded in [1:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:9) and [1:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:10). Alternate translation: “Mithredath turned them over to Sheshbazzar along with a detailed list of them”

## Ezra 1:8 (#6) (id: 462518)

**"to Sheshbazzar"**

This leader of the first group of exiles to return to Judah, who is called **Sheshbazzar** here and in [1:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:11), [5:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:14), and [5:16](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:16), seems to be the same person who is called Zerubbabel in the rest of the book. The reason for the difference in names is not clear. Some interpreters suggest that he was known as Sheshbazzar in the Persian court and that he used the name Zerubbabel as governor of Judah. There are examples in the Bible of Jews having both a Persian name and a Hebrew name. It would probably be best simply to translate both names consistently where they appear without calling attention to the difference, but you could add this possible explanation in a footnote.

## Ezra 1:8 (#7) (id: 462519)

**"the ruler of Judah"**

The book says in [5:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:14) that Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar to be the governor of the province of Judah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use that phrase to describe him here. Alternate translation: “whom Cyrus had appointed to be the governor of the province of Judah”

## Ezra 1:9 (#2) (id: 462521)

**"knives"**

This word occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible, and there is some disagreement about its meaning. It is probably a borrowed term from a related language that means “knife,” but the ancient Greek translation took its meaning to be “replacements,” that is, basins to replace others that became unusable. You may see translations that follow the ancient Greek, but we recommend following the Hebrew.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:9

## Ezra 1:10 (#1) (id: 462522)

**"bowls of silver of a second kind"**

This means that these bowls were a different type of bowl than the gold ones just mentioned. This could also mean that they were second in rank of status or honor behind the gold bowls. It does not mean that the silver was of a different type than the silver in the basins described in [1:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:9).

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:10

## Ezra 1:11 (#1) (id: 462523)

**"All the vessels of gold and of silver were 5400"**

This expression means that the total number of these gold and silver objects was **5,400**. Verses [1:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:9) and [1:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:10) actually list only 2,499 items, and it is not clear why the numbers are different. The explanation does not seem to be that the total here includes other miscellaneous items because the last item on the list itself is other vessels. It would probably be best simply to report this total without calling attention to the difference and trying to explain it, since there is no clear reason for it.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 1:11

## Ezra 1:11 (#2) (id: 462524)

**"Sheshbazzar brought up all this with the going up of the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem"**

Like the similar expression in [1:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:3), here the book says **brought up** and **going up** because the Jews had to travel from a river valley up into the mountains to return from exile to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “Sheshbazzar brought all these vessels along when he traveled to Jerusalem with the group of Jews who had been taken away from their homeland but who were now returning from Babylon to Jerusalem”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with an equivalent phrase.

**"from Babylon"**

**Babylon** is the name of a city. The book also uses this name for the empire that was once ruled from that city, and for the region that had been at the heart of this empire that became a province in the Persian Empire. The name occurs many times in the book, and it will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.

This is the high priest, who has the same name as the Levite who is introduced in [2:40](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:40). The spelling of this name varies throughout the Bible.

**"the house of their fathers or their seed, whether they were from Israel"**

All three of these phrases, **the house of their fathers**, **their seed**, and **whether they were from Israel**, mean very similar things. They are used together to give clarity and emphasis. The first phrase refers to a person being able to name a well\-known ancestor. The second phrase refers to a person being able to list his ancestors going back to the one that is well\-known. The third phrase summarizes the other two: if a person cannot name an ancestor or recite his ancestry, then he cannot claim to be from Israel. If there would be no distinction between these phrases in your language, you could combine them into one phrase. Alternate translations: “that their ancestors had been Israelites” or “what clan they were from or who their ancestors were, whether they were really Israelites”

In ancient times, **gold darics** each weighed about 8 or 8\.5 grams, or about a quarter of an ounce. You could try to express this in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. Instead, you might say something general like “61,000 gold coins,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note.

Ezra 3 General Notes
====================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

This chapter begins the story of the building of the temple and re\-establishment of worship in the new temple. (See: Temple)

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Rebuilding the temple

They immediately began the temple worship even though the temple had not yet been built because they feared the people of the surrounding nations.

* **Associated Articles:** Temple (ID: 27142)

## Ezra 3:1 (#1) (id: 462681)

**"Then"** \- **"came"**

The word **then** indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After this group had returned to Judah”

## Ezra 3:1 (#2) (id: 462682)

**"Then the seventh month came"**

This phrase refers to the beginning of the seventh month in the Jewish religious calendar, which is the first month in the Jewish civic calendar. The phrase is actually giving the reason why the people gathered in Jerusalem at this time. It was the start of a new year, and the leadership had decided to resume community worship, including daily sacrifices, as of the beginning of that year, as [3:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:6) indicates. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “At the start of the seventh month, because it was the beginning of a new civic year”

## Ezra 3:1 (#4) (id: 462684)

**"the seventh month"**

You could convert the Hebrew **month** into an equivalent on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the equivalency will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the number of the Hebrew month.

## Ezra 3:1 (#5) (id: 462685)

**"and the sons of Israel were in their cities. And the people were gathered together"** \- **"to Jerusalem"**

Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers why the Israelites were not all in Jerusalem already and would have had to come there from various places.

**"burnt up offerings"**

The book assumes that readers will know that this means whole burnt offerings, that is, sacrifices that were burned up completely on the altar. These were offered to express a desire to be in good standing with God through the complete sacrifice of something valuable and also through the creation of an aroma, the smell of roasting meat, that was considered to be pleasing to God. If your language has a special term for such offerings, you can use it in your translation. Alternate translation: “whole burnt offerings”

## Ezra 3:3 (#1) (id: 462700)

**"And they set up the altar on its foundation, for dread was on them because of the peoples of the lands"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because they were afraid of the people from other groups who lived around them, thinking they might attack them, they wanted to ask God for help and protection, so they made rebuilding the altar their first priority” or “Because they were afraid of the people from other groups who lived around them, thinking they might try to stop them from rebuilding the temple, they wanted to get started on rebuilding as quickly as possible, and so they began right away with the altar”

## Ezra 3:3 (#2) (id: 462701)

**"And they set up the altar on its foundation"**

This phrase likely means that the priests and leaders built this new altar right at the place where the altar had been located within the former temple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that as an alternate translation.

## Ezra 3:3 (#3) (id: 462702)

**"for dread was on them because of the peoples of the lands"**

The book does not say specifically why the Israelites were afraid of the people from other groups who lived around them. Two possibilities are that they were afraid these people might attack them or that they might try to keep them from rebuilding the temple, in both cases to stop them from re\-establishing themselves in their former homeland. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could suggest one of these explanations explicitly. Alternate translation: “because they were afraid that the people from other groups who lived around them might attack them, they wanted to ask God for help and protection” or “because they were afraid that the people from other groups who lived around them might try to stop them from rebuilding the temple, they wanted to get started on rebuilding as quickly as possible”

**"dread was on them"**

Here the book uses a spatial metaphor of **dread** or fear landing **on** or resting **on** the Israelites to express that the Israelites felt that emotion. Alternate translation: “they were very afraid”

**"because of the peoples of the lands"**

This was the expression that the Jews used to refer to members of other people groups, including some that the Assyrians had brought into the area who were originally from other places (**lands**) but who were now living in and around the province of Judah. Alternate translation: “people from other groups”

## Ezra 3:3 (#6) (id: 462705)

**"Then they offered up on it burnt up offerings to Yahweh, burnt up offerings at the morning and at the evening"**

The word **then** at the beginning of this sentence indicates that the activity it describes took place after the events the story has been describing. Specifically, this was a continuous activity, not something the leaders did just on that occasion. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “from that time on.” Alternate translation: “From that time on, the priests offered sacrifices to Yahweh on this altar every morning and every evening”

## Ezra 3:3 (#7) (id: 462706)

**"Then they offered up on it burnt up offerings to Yahweh, burnt up offerings at the morning and at the evening"**

As [3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2) notes, God had commanded these daily **offerings** in the law of Moses. By resuming them, the leaders and priests were restoring the regular worship life of the community. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “From that time on, the priests offered sacrifices to Yahweh on this altar every morning and every evening. By doing that, they restored the regular worship life of the community”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this relationship by using an equivalent phrase. The next event is specifically the Festival of Tabernacles, which the law of Moses said to observe from the fifteenth through the twenty\-second days of the seventh month.

Here the book leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning seems to be that once the daily morning and evening sacrifices had been re\-instituted, the less frequent sacrifices were resumed as well, including those for the new moon, for the annual festivals, and on the occasion of freewill offerings. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers.

While these are all general terms that describe categories of things, the book is likely using them to refer to specific items within each category. While **food** means anything to eat, here it probably means grain, which the Israelites grew in their land and which they could transport relatively easily. Similarly, **drink** means anything to drink, but it probably means wine, and **oil** probably means olive oil, because these were both things that the Israelites also produced and could transport.

The book does not say explicitly why the Jewish leaders started the actual construction of the new temple at this time. One possibility is that once they had ordered the necessary materials, as [3:7](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:7) describes, it took seven months for enough materials to be delivered for construction to begin. Another possibility is that the leaders waited until spring because winter would have been a bad time to start building. Yet another possibility is that they wanted to lay the foundation of this new temple in the second month of the year for ceremonial reasons, because that was the month in which King Solomon had laid the foundation of the original temple.

Alternate translation: “Then the builders completed the floor of the temple of Yahweh” or (2\) It means that they started to lay the foundation, and the ceremony with the music is to mark the start of the building. Alternate translation: “Then the builders started to lay the foundation of the temple of Yahweh”

**"And they caused to stand the clothed priests with the trumpets"**

Unlike in [2:63](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:63) and [3:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:9), here **stand** means that the **priests** and **Levites** literally stood. They took up standing positions around the foundation and played their instruments.

## Ezra 3:11 (#2) (id: 462772)

**"Then they sang in response"**

Here, **they** refers to the Levite singers. **In response** probably means that first one group of them sang something, and then a second group of them sang something in reply, possibly playing instruments as well. The groups likely did this repeatedly over the course of a given song. Alternate translations: “Then the Levites sang responsively” or “Then the Levites sang antiphonally”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 3:11

## Ezra 3:11 (#3) (id: 462773)

**"For he is good, for his covenant faithfulness to Israel is to eternity"**

This is at least part of the song that the Levites sang on this occasion. Based on their other occurrences in the Bible, these may be the words to a refrain that the second group sang in response to verses that the first group sang. Or this may be a song that was sung for this celebration. Either way, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate that these are the words of the singers by setting off them with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

**"were weeping with a loud voice"**

The book does not say specifically why these older leaders who had seen the first temple were weeping. There are two possibilities. (1\) They felt grief and loss because they remembered the first temple in all of its glory and they could not imagine that this replacement would ever be as splendid. Alternate translation: “wept loudly because they thought this new temple could never be as glorious as the first one” or (2\) Seeing the community begin to restore its temple brought back memories of the terrible days in which the original temple had been destroyed and the people had had to leave their homes and go into exile.

## Ezra 3:12 (#5) (id: 462782)

**"at the founding of this house in their eyes"**

As in [3:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:6), **founding** means to do the first step of constructing a building. See how you translated it there. Since it is a reference to the first step, laying a foundation, it may simply refer to starting the project generally. It could mean that the workers had begun to lay the foundation or that they had finished the foundation. Alternate translation: “when they saw the foundation that the builders laid for this temple”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 3:12

## Ezra 3:12 (#6) (id: 462783)

Ezra 4 General Notes
====================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

The story of the building of the temple and re\-establishment of the temple worship continues in this chapter. (See: Temple)

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Helping to build the temple

The people of the surrounding nations offered to help to build the temple. It is unknown why the Jews refused their help, although it seems likely that the Jews considered these people to not truly belong to the people of God. These other people became their enemies and tried to hinder the work. They even persuaded the king of Persia to stop the Jews from building.

* **Associated Articles:** Temple (ID: 27142)

## Ezra 4:1 (#1) (id: 462792)

**"Now"** \- **"heard"**

The word **Now** indicates that the sentence it introduces will provide background information that will be needed to understand what the book describes next. You can translate it with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance.

* **Associated Articles:** Background Information (ID: 33415)

## Ezra 4:1 (#2) (id: 462793)

**"Judah and Benjamin"**

Here the book is referring to the people who came from the tribe of Judah as if they were a single person, their ancestor Judah. It is referring similarly to the people of the tribe of Benjamin as if they were a single person, their ancestor Benjamin. Alternate translation: “the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin” or see the next note for a further possibility.

## Ezra 4:1 (#3) (id: 462794)

**"Judah and Benjamin"**

Here the book may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. Together the two words may be a way of referring to all of the Israelites, since at this point the community consisted essentially of people from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Alternate translation: “the Israelites”

## Ezra 4:1 (#4) (id: 462795)

**"Now"** \- **"heard that the sons of the exile were building a temple"**

**Heard** means that these enemies learned by some means that the Jews were doing this. The book is using hearing, one means of discovering things, to describe the enemies learning this. Alternate translation: “Now … learned that the Jews who had returned from exile were building a temple”

* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: 33315)

**"the sons of the exile"**

As indicated in [2:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:1) and [8:35](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:35), the phrase **the sons of the exile** refers specifically to the group of Jewish people who returned to the land of Judah from Babylon. Babylon was the country where King Nebuchadnezzar had taken many Jews as captives after he conquered Jerusalem. Alternate translations: “the Jews who had returned from exile” or “the Jews who had returned to their homeland”

* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: 33267)

## Ezra 4:2 (#5) (id: 462802)

**"and they said to them, “Let us build with you"**

Since the book says in the previous verse that these people were enemies of the Jews, the implication is that they were not sincere when they claimed that they wanted to help build the temple. Instead, they were probably looking for a way to hinder the building project from within. The Jewish leaders refused their offer, and that suggests that they themselves suspected that these people were insincere. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and attempting to deceive the Jews, they said to them, ‘We would like to help you build the temple’”

## Ezra 4:3 (#11) (id: 462817)

**"just as the king Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us"**

It is implicit in the story that the Jewish leaders know that they cannot trust these foreign leaders, whom the story describes as their enemies. The Jewish leaders suggest indirectly that they do not accept their claim that they worship Yahweh. They say, “It is not for you … to build a house for our God,” and they describe Yahweh as the God of Israel exclusively. But apparently they cannot contradict the claim directly, perhaps for reasons of etiquette and diplomacy. Instead, it seems that they find convenient grounds to exclude foreigners from the temple project in the literal wording of the proclamation that Cyrus issued: “Whoever among you is from all his people … may he build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel” ([1:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:3)). It may be possible in your translation to translate this phrase in such a way that your readers will implicitly recognize it as the convenient excuse that it apparently is. Alternate translation: “for that is what King Cyrus of Persia commanded”

These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “making the people of Judah so intimidated that they stopped working on the temple” However, there is a slight distinction between the phrases. The first one describes how the people felt inwardly, and the second one explains what effect this had on their outward actions. So you could also translate the phrases separately.

## Ezra 4:6 (#2) (id: 462829)

**"Now in the reign of Ahasuerus,in the beginning of his reign"**

Ahasuerus ruled the Persian Empire after Darius, who was his father. So here the book is presenting some events out of chronological order. That is, it is telling about some things that happened later, before finishing the story of what happened at this time. In [4:24](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:24) the book will bring readers back to where it left off in [4:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:5), and then, in [5:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:1), it will describe how work on rebuilding the temple did resume under the reign of Darius. But first it gives accounts here of how the enemies of the Jews continued to oppose them under two later kings, Ahasuerus (described in this verse) and Artaxerxes (described in verses [7–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:7-Ezra4:23)). The purpose may be to show that the Jews were wise to refuse the help that leaders from other nations offered, as described in [4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:1-Ezra4:3). Since those leaders were actually enemies of the Jews, as they demonstrated by opposing them under one king after another, their offer was not sincere and they could not be trusted. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “In fact, they continued to oppose them under later kings. As soon as Ahasuerus succeeded his father Darius as king”

**"and the script of the letter was written in Aramaic and was interpreted in Aramaic"**

This is background information that helps readers understand how these officials went about writing to the king. Aramaic was the official language for government correspondence within the Persian empire. These officials apparently spoke Samaritan, a language similar to Hebrew. So they had someone express their message for them in the Aramaic language. The term **interpreted** does not necessarily indicate that the officials first wrote out their letter in Samaritan, and then someone translated it into Aramaic for them. Instead, they may have told someone what they wanted to say, and that person composed the letter in Aramaic. Since Aramaic also used differently shaped letters from the ones that Hebrew and Samaritan used, that person wrote the letter using those characters. Alternate translation: “these officials arranged for someone to write their letter for them in the Aramaic script and language”

**"and was interpreted in Aramaic"**

We might expect that, logically, this phrase would come before the previous one, written in the **Aramaic** script, since the letter had to be composed before it was written down. But in its present position at the end of this sentence, this phrase actually serves a larger purpose within the book. It signals readers that what follows, through [6:18](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:18), is itself written in Aramaic. Presumably the original readers, who were clearly expected to understand both languages, would have been alert to such a signal. (A long Aramaic section in the book of Daniel is introduced similarly: “Then the wise men spoke to the king in Aramaic,” Daniel 2:4\.) Alternate translation: “and was translated into Aramaic such as the following:”

In [5:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:17), it comes near the end of a letter to introduce a request that the writers finally make in light of extensive background information that they provide up to that point. But here it introduces the letter itself after a long preamble that lists the names of the senders and the groups on whose behalf they feel they can speak. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation.

Here, as in several instances earlier in the book, **went up** means “traveled from Babylon to Judah,” since that involves going from a river valley up into the mountains. The officials describe Babylon to the king as **near you** because it was relatively much closer to the Persian royal court and more distant from Samaria.

**Rebellious and evil** mean similar things.

## Ezra 4:12 (#8) (id: 462877)

**"they are completing the walls and repairing the foundations"**

Here, **completing** is a way of saying “building.” Several times in this section of Ezra, the text uses the two words **repairing** and **completing** together to mean “building,” or it uses them as poetic parallels. (For example, “which a great king of Israel built and completed,” [5:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11), and “to build this house and to complete this structure,” [5:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:3).) The term **completing** by itself here seems similarly to have the meaning of “building.” **Repairing** here could also mean “digging out.” Either way, this is a reference to preparing foundations so that buildings can be set up on them. So the officials are describing the project of restoring the city by referring to the work on two parallel parts of it, its walls and its buildings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this without using a similar figure of speech. Alternate translations: “they are working throughout the city to restore it” or “they are rebuilding the walls and preparing foundations for buildings”

**"if that city is built and the walls are completed"**

These two phrases mean similar things. (As noted in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:12), **completed** is another way of saying **built** when the terms are paired like this.) Likely for emphasis, the officials say essentially the same thing twice to create an ominous sense of threat. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “if they are able to rebuild that city” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is actually stronger and more threatening, because the city walls could prevent Artaxerxes from reasserting his sovereignty by force. Alternate translation: “if they rebuild the city, and especially if they restore its protective walls”

**"they will not give tax, tribute, or custom"**

**Tax**, **tribute**, and **custom** mean similar things. The officials use the three terms together to emphasize that the king could lose all of his income from the Jews living in Jerusalem and the province of Judah. However, there is a slight difference between the three terms. While their exact meaning is uncertain, they may refer to these three kinds of taxes: taxes based on a percentage of income, tribute money that subjects would pay on a per\-person basis, and duty that they would pay on articles purchased for use or transported for sale. Alternate translation: “they will no longer pay taxes, tribute, or duty” But if you do not have three different words for different kinds of taxes in your language, you could just use one word, as in the UST. (A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.)

The officials are writing to a king who is the sole ruler of his empire, but they may be using the plural **kings** here because previous kings had accumulated much of the royal treasures. The officials may also be suggesting implicitly that not only Artaxerxes, but also his successors, will get no further revenue from the Jews if Jerusalem is rebuilt and fortified. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and this will reduce the income of kings”

He responds in [4:19](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:19) that he had his court officials search in this collection. Verses [6:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:1-Ezra6:2) describe how Darius earlier made a similar search. Alternate translation: “in the royal chronicles” or “in the archives of the previous kings”

But it also seems to include the Assyrian and Babylonian kings to whose empires the Persian kings were now the heirs. The revolts of Jerusalem that this search discovered, as reported in [4:19](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:19), were against the Babylonians. Indeed, Artaxerxes says that his officials investigated the matter back to ancient days, presumably back to the times of earlier empires. Alternate translation: “the chronicles of previous kings”

**"Now"**

The word **Now** is similar to the expression “and now” in [4:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:10), [4:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:11), and [4:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:17). As in [4:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:13) and [4:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:14), it introduces an important point within a letter. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that in your translation.

## Ezra 4:21 (#2) (id: 462924)

**"set a decree to stop these men"**

**These men** means the Jews. This is a reference back to the letter from the Samaritan officials in which they speak of “the Jews who went up from near you” and who “have come to us at Jerusalem” ([4:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:12)). The implication is that the Jews are to stop rebuilding the walls and buildings in Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “issue a decree to make those Jews who returned to Jerusalem from exile stop rebuilding the walls and buildings in Jerusalem”

## Ezra 4:21 (#3) (id: 462925)

**"so that city may not be rebuilt until the decree is set from me"**

The phrase **so that** indicates that the clause that follows describes the purpose for which Artaxerxes wants the officials to issue a decree. It is to make the Jews stop working on the walls and houses. He does not want there to be any rebuilding in Jerusalem unless he authorizes it personally. Alternate translation: “because I want this decree to prevent all rebuilding unless I issue a decree permitting it”

## Ezra 4:22 (#1) (id: 462926)

**"And be careful of negligence of action concerning this"**

This means “Be sure to act concerning this.” This is a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using two negative expressions: **be careful of**, that is, “avoid,” together with an expression that is the opposite of what is desired: **negligence of action**. Artaxerxes wants the officials to take action. Alternate translation: “Be sure to take action in response to this situation”

## Ezra 4:22 (#2) (id: 462927)

**"Why should the damage increase to the harm of the kings"**

The implication is that if the Jews were able to rebuild and fortify Jerusalem and they revolted, then the interests of the king would be damaged because he would lose honor, as the officials suggest in their letter ([4:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:14)), and he would also lose revenue ([4:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:13)). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Why should I and other kings suffer dishonor or lose tribute money”

## Ezra 4:22 (#3) (id: 462928)

**"Why should the damage increase to the harm of the kings"**

Artaxerxes is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the Samaritan officials to tell him why he should experience greater damage. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for the officials to get the Jews to stop rebuilding Jerusalem. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I should not suffer dishonor or lose tribute money.”

## Ezra 4:22 (#4) (id: 462929)

**"Why should the damage increase to the harm of the kings"**

As in [4:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:13), the plural **kings** here may envision that not just Artaxerxes but also his successors would lose revenue if Jerusalem leads a revolt that spreads throughout Beyond\-the\-River, as the Samaritan officials suggest it would. But Artaxerxes is speaking primarily of himself, in the third person, as kings sometimes did, just as their subjects addressed them in the third person to show humility and respect. (Compare, for example, the way Cyrus speaks of himself in the third person in [6:4](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:4), and Darius speaks of himself that way in [6:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:8) and [6:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:10)).

**"from when the copy of the letter of Artaxerxes the king was read aloud before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions"**

The implication is that a messenger brought a copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes to these officials and read it aloud to them. (See the note to [4:18](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:18) for background to the practice of reading correspondence out loud.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly.

**"and they stopped them by an arm and strength"**

The phrase **an arm and strength** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” The word **strength** tells what kind of **arm** or influence these officials used: a strong arm, that is, a forcibly coercive one. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of the two words in a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and they compelled them to stop”

## Ezra 4:24 (#1) (id: 462941)

**"At that time the work of the house of God which is in Jerusalem stopped"**

The book now returns to the point in the story where it left off at the end of [4:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:5). (If it would be helpful, review the note to [4:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:6). That note explains how the book tells of later events in [4:6–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:6-Ezra4:23) to show that the Jews were wise not to trust the Samaritans when they offered to help rebuild the temple during the reign of Cyrus, since they demonstrated by their repeated future opposition that they really were the enemies of the Jews.) It might be useful to include a heading before this verse to alert the reader that there is a change of timeframe at this point, such as, “Building the Temple in the Time of Darius.” Also, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something explicitly here that would show how the book is returning to the time of Cyrus and his immediate successors. Alternate translation: “This is how the enemies of the Jews tried, under later kings, to stop them from rebuilding Jerusalem. They attempted the same thing under King Cyrus and his successors and they were able to stop the work on the temple for a time”

Ezra 5 General Notes
====================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

The story of the building of the temple and re\-establishment of the temple worship continues in this chapter from where it left off in [4:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:5). (See: Temple)

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Rebuilding the temple

The prophets Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the Jews to begin again to build the temple. This was very important to life in Judah. (See: Prophet)

* **Associated Articles:** Prophet (ID: 26987); Temple (ID: 27142)

## Ezra 5:1 (#1) (id: 462944)

**"Then"** \- **"prophesied"**

Here, the word **Then** introduces a new event in the story. Use a natural method in your language to introduce a new event here.

* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Ezra 5:1 (#2) (id: 462945)

**"Then"** \- **"prophesied"**

The word **Then** indicates that the event the story will now relate took place at the time just named in [4:24](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:24), that is, in the second year of the reign of Darius as king of Persia. Alternate translation: “At that time … prophesied”

## Ezra 5:1 (#5) (id: 462948)

**"Then"** \- **"prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem"**

The implication, based on how the Jewish leaders respond in the next verse, is that Haggai and Zechariah said specifically that the Jews should resume work on rebuilding the temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “told the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem that they should start rebuilding the temple again”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 5:3

## Ezra 5:3 (#8) (id: 462964)

**"to build this house and to complete this structure"**

These two phrases mean essentially the same thing. As noted in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:12), **complete** is another way of saying **build** when the terms are paired like this. The officials say essentially the same thing twice for emphasis. If that would be confusing for your readers, you could say it once and provide emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “to build a large temple such as this”

## Ezra 5:4 (#1) (id: 462966)

**"Then"**

Here, the word **Then** is indicating that the enemies asked the question in this verse right after the question they asked in the previous verse. (The word is not indicating that the two questions were asked on separate occasions.) Alternate translation: “In addition”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 5:4
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Sequential Time Relationship (ID: 33333)

## Ezra 5:4 (#2) (id: 462967)

**"we said to them, “What are the names of the men"**

Here, the Aramaic text reads **we said**. The pronoun does not seem to fit the context here, because of the sudden, unexplained shift from third person “they” in verse 3 to first person “we” here. In [5:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:10), in their letter to Darius, Tattenai and his associates use “we” when they report that they were the ones who asked this question. So the word “we” could have been mistakenly copied into this verse from that one. Other ancient versions say “they,” and it will likely be clearest for your readers if you translate the phrase in that way. Alternate translation: “they said to them, ‘What are the men's names’” or “they said to them, ‘Who are the men’” It is also possible that the verse is not reporting a question in direct speech, but is simply describing what was said as a statement. In that case, **we** would refer to the Jews. Alternate translation: “we told them who the men were” or “we told them the names of the men \[who were building this building.”]

* **Associated Articles:** Direct and Indirect Quotations (ID: 33305)

## Ezra 5:5 (#1) (id: 462969)

**"But the eye of"**

Here, the word **But** indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between what Tattenai and his associates were trying to accomplish, which was an immediate end to the rebuilding of the temple, and what actually happened. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “however” to indicate this contrast.

## Ezra 5:5 (#2) (id: 462970)

**"But the eye of God was on the elders of the Jews"**

Here, **eye** stands for seeing, and in this context, seeing means giving care, protection, and favor. Alternate translation: “God was making sure that the Jewish leaders would be alright”

## Ezra 5:5 (#4) (id: 462972)

**"and they did not stop them until the report came to Darius"**

Here the word **they** refers to Tattenai and his associates. The implication is that they did not make the Jewish leaders stop rebuilding the temple right away. Rather, they chose to wait until they could send a report about the rebuilding to Darius, to see what he would say about it. Alternate translation: “and Tattenai and his associates did not make the Jews stop rebuilding the temple right away, but they decided instead to report the matter to King Darius”

**"they returned the letter concerning this matter"**

Here the word **they** primarily refers to Darius. As in [4:18](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:18), the plural may be used to indicate the king and his officials, who would consider the matter openly in the royal court. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the singular. Alternate translation: “he sent back a letter to tell them what to do about this”

**"To Darius the king: All peace"**

Here the book begins to quote the letter that Tattenai and his associates sent to King Darius. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation.

**"To Darius"**

**Darius** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [4:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:5).

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 5:7

## Ezra 5:7 (#3) (id: 462979)

**"All peace"**

As in [4:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:17), this is a conventional greeting or good wish that senders at this time often included at the beginning of a letter. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for the same purpose, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “Greetings” or “We hope all is well with you”

## Ezra 5:8 (#1) (id: 462980)

**"Let it be known to the king"**

These officials address the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this respect by using an expression such as “O king.” Alternate translation: “We would like you to know, O king”

## Ezra 5:8 (#4) (id: 462983)

**"to the house of the great God"**

Here, **the house** refers to the temple. The officials speak of it as if it were a place in which God would live. (They likely say **the great God** because the Jews told them, as they report in [5:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11), that it would be a temple for the God who made heaven and earth.)

**"and it is being built of large stones, and timber is being placed in the walls"**

**"And this work is being done diligently and is succeeding in their hand"**

## Ezra 5:9 (#1) (id: 462987)

**"Who set a decree for you to build this house and to complete this structure"**

This is a quotation within a quotation. That is, the book is quoting from the letter that Tattenai and his associates sent to King Darius, and within that letter, they are quoting what they asked the Jewish elders. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off these words within secondary quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation.

* **Associated Articles:** Quote Markings (ID: 33306)

**"Who set a decree for you to build this house and to complete this structure"**

See how you translated this question in [5:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:3). The phrases **build this house** and **complete this structure** refer to the same action, not different actions. The officials say essentially the same thing twice for emphasis. If that would be confusing for your readers, you could say it once and provide emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “Who said that you could build a large temple such as this”

**"And also we asked of them their names, to let you know, so that we could write down the names of the men who were at their head"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could put the reason before the result. (We do not know if Tattenai and his associates succeeded in writing down the list of names.) Alternate translation: “We wanted to write down the names of their leaders and to be prepared to let you know who they were, so we also asked them their names”

## Ezra 5:11 (#1) (id: 462992)

**"We are servants of him who is the God of heaven and earth"**

The Jewish leaders describe themselves as **servants** of God because they are speaking of a superior with humility and respect. However, in this context, the expression is also an idiom that indicates that this is the God whom they worship. Alternate translation: “We worship the God who created heaven and earth”

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Ezra 5:11 (#2) (id: 462993)

## Ezra 5:11 (#3) (id: 462994)

**"and we are building the house"**

**House** means the temple. This seems to be an abbreviated way of saying the “house of God,” a figurative description of the temple as the place where God lived. Alternate translation: “and we are rebuilding the temple”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 5:11
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 5:11 (#4) (id: 462995)

**"and a great king of Israel built it and completed it"**

In this section of the book, **completed** is another way of saying **built** when the two words are used together. (Review the note about this at [4:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:12) if that would be helpful.) So the Jewish elders are expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a single word. Alternate translation: “which a great king of Israel constructed”

**"We are servants of him who is the God of heaven and earth"**

Starting here, and through [5:16](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:16), there is another quotation within a quotation. The book is quoting from the letter that Tattenai and his associates sent to King Darius, and within that letter, they are quoting what the Jewish elders told them in response to their question. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening secondary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation.

## Ezra 5:12 (#1) (id: 462996)

**"However"**

The word **However** indicates that there will be a contrast between the sentence that it introduces and the previous one. This sentence expresses the opposite of what someone would hope and expect to happen after a great king built a temple for God, so you could begin the sentence with a word such as “unfortunately” to indicate this contrast.

**"he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar"**

Nebuchadnezzar alone did not conquer the kingdom of Judah. Rather, the elders are describing his armies by reference to something associated with them, the emperor who commanded them. Alternate translation: “God allowed them to be conquered by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar”

**"the Chaldean"**

Here the elders provide some further background information about who Nebuchadnezzar was. Even though he was the ruler of the Babylonian Empire, he was not from the Babylonian people group himself, but rather from the Chaldean people group. Alternate translation: “who was from the Chaldean people group”

## Ezra 5:12 (#8) (id: 463003)

**"and he destroyed this house"**

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 5:13 (#1) (id: 463004)

**"But"**

Here, the word **But** indicates that the sentence it introduces draws a contrast between the way Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the temple and the way Cyrus commanded it to be rebuilt. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this contrast.

## Ezra 5:13 (#2) (id: 463005)

**"in year one of Cyrus"**

The original text uses a cardinal number here, **one**, but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way it uses an ordinal number, “first,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of years, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “in the first year of Cyrus”

## Ezra 5:13 (#4) (id: 463007)

**"the king of Babylon"**

Cyrus was the king of the Persian Empire, but since under his leadership the Persians had conquered the Babylonians, he also had the right to use the title **king of Babylon**. The implication may be that as the heir and successor to the throne of Babylon, Cyrus had the same power over the temple as Nebuchadnezzar, and so he could order it to be rebuilt. Alternate translation: “who conquered Babylon.”

This sentence may be hard for readers to follow because, in it, the direct object (that is, the thing that receives the action) comes first, and it consists of a very long phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could break this sentence into two sentences. Alternate translation: “Nebuchadnezzar had taken the gold and silver objects that were used in worship out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought them to the temple in Babylon. King Cyrus took them out of the temple in Babylon and gave them to … Sheshbazzar” See also the UST.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 5:14

## Ezra 5:14 (#2) (id: 463009)

**"the vessels of the house of God"**

This means specifically the bowls, basins, and other objects listed in [1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:9-Ezra1:10). These **vessels** were used during worship in the temple. Alternate translation: “the objects that were used in worship in the temple”

**"Take away these vessels. Go deposit them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built on its place"**

This is a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. The book is quoting from the letter that Tattenai and his associates sent to King Darius. Within that letter, they are quoting what the Jewish elders told them in response to their question. And within that response, the elders are quoting what King Cyrus told Sheshbazzar to do. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off this part of the verse within tertiary quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Another option would be to present this as an indirect quotation, as in the UST.

## Ezra 5:16 (#4) (id: 463020)

**"And from then even until now it is being built, but it is not complete"**

In several places the book uses the terms **built and complete** together to mean “constructed.” (Review the note about this at [5:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11) if that would be helpful.) But this expression means something different here. Because there is a **not** before the second verb, here the expression means that the temple was only partially rebuilt, and then the work was interrupted. Be sure that your translation shows this difference. Alternate translation: “And ever since then, we have been trying to rebuild the temple, but we still have much work to do on it”

Here the letter ends its quotation of what the Jewish elders told Tattenai and his associates. If you decided in [5:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11) to mark their words as a secondary quotation, you should indicate that ending here with a closing secondary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation.

## Ezra - Chapter 6 Introduction (id: 718619)

Ezra 6 General Notes
====================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

The completion of the story of the building of the temple and re\-establishment of the temple worship occurs in this chapter. (See: Temple)

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Temple taxes

The king said that the Jews were right and ordered money from his taxes to be used to help them with their sacrifices.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Darius

In this chapter, Darius is called the king of Assyria. In reality, besides ruling over the former Assyrian Empire, Darius was also king of Persia. Persia had conquered Babylon, which had previously conquered Assyria. This made the king of Persia to be the king of Assyria as well. It was unusual to refer to Darius as the king or ruler of Assyria. Ezra may have referred to him in this way to contrast Darius’ actions with those of the former rulers of Assyria, who had treated the Jews very cruelly. Those earlier Assyrian rulers were the ones who had conquered the northern tribes of Israel and deported them to other lands. It was for this reason that the northern tribes lost their identity and were no longer a distinct people group.

The implication is that King Darius ordered his officials to search in the royal archives to investigate the claims that the Jewish elders had made in response to the questions that Tattenai and his associates asked them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Darius commanded his officials to investigate whether King Cyrus had issued a decree to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem by searching”

## Ezra 6:3 (#5) (id: 463046)

**"Let the house be built,"** \- **"and let its foundations be raised"**

The words **built** and **raised** mean similar things. They are a poetic parallel, as in Isaiah 58:12, “Your ancient ruins will be built; you will raise up the foundations of many generations.” Cyrus says basically the same thing twice for emphasis and clarity. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “I authorize the Jews to raise up a new temple.” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is more specific in that it implicitly indicates that the new temple is to be built on the site of the former one. Alternate translation: “I authorize the Jews to rebuild the temple … on the site of the former temple”

## Ezra 6:4 (#1) (id: 463050)

**"with three layers of large stone and a layer of new timber"**

It is no longer clear exactly what these building instructions mean. They could mean that the walls of the temple should be three layers of stone thick, with a facing of wood on the inside. They could also mean that the walls should be built with one layer of wood on top of every three layers of stone, or that the temple was to have four stories, the lower three of stone and the top one of wood. Whatever the specifics, the implication is that the temple is to be rebuilt in the same way that Solomon originally built it, since 1 Kings 6:36 says that he built its inner court, at least, “with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly.

**"Now Tattenai"**

Here the book leaves out some of the material that a story would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Rather than repeating the same information from the scroll, but now as a letter to the officials, it jumps right from its quotation from the scroll that was discovered at Ecbatana and into the letter that King Darius wrote to Tattenai and his associates in response to what the scroll said. You could say this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “When King Darius learned from the scroll that Cyrus had ordered the temple to be rebuilt, he sent Tattenai and his associates a letter in answer to their inquiry. He told them what he had learned from the scroll and then warned them, ‘Now Tattenai’”

As in [4:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:13), [4:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:14), and [4:21](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:21), **now** introduces an important point within a letter. (It is similar to the expression “and now” in [4:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:10), [4:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:11), [4:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:17), and [5:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:17).)

**"Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, Shethar\-Bozenai, and their companions, the officials who are in Beyond\-the\-River: be far away from there"**

Since Darius addresses these men directly at the end of the sentence, instead of **their companions**, in the third person, we would expect him to say “your companions,” in the second person. So it seems that the book is compressing the letter as it quotes it. Based on the other letters that the book quotes in [4:11–16](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:11-Ezra4:16), [4:17–22](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:17-Ezra4:22), and [5:7–17](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:7-Ezra5:17), the full letter probably said something like “To Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, Shethar\-Bozenai, and their companions, the officials who are in Beyond\-the\-River. Peace. And now,” followed by an explanation that the court officials had discovered a scroll that recorded the decree of Cyrus. Then would follow instructions to these men, beginning “Be far away from there!” But since the quotation from this letter in the book jumps from the list of the recipients’ names right to these instructions, If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the second person throughout. Alternate translation: “Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, Shethar\-Bozenai, and your associates, you officials who are in Beyond\-the\-River: Be far away from there”

**"be far away from there"**

King Darius uses a spatial metaphor to indicate that he wants Tattenai and his associates not to interfere with what the Jews are doing in Jerusalem. The meaning is not simply that they are to stay away physically from that area, since they could still plot against the Jews from a distance (for example, by bribing officials in the royal court, as [4:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:5) describes). Alternate translation: “do not interfere with what is happening in Jerusalem”

If that would be confusing for your readers, you could combine the two sentences and express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation for both sentences: “do not interfere with the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem in any way” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is more specific. It says precisely what Darius wants these Samaritan officials to leave alone. Alternate translation: “Do not interfere with what is happening in Jerusalem. Do not disturb the work on the temple there!”

This sentence, like the one in [5:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:14), may be hard for readers to follow because the thing that receives the action comes first, and it consists of a very long phrase. This sentence continues into the next verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could break it up into four sentences, three in this verse and the last one in verse [10](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:10).

Here, **sons** could mean one of two things. (1\) It could be literal and mean the biological sons of King Darius. (2\) It could be figurative and mean descendants, specifically those whom Darius hoped would succeed him on the throne. As the note to [4:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:15) explains, the Persian kings spoke of predecessor kings as their “fathers,” so they may also have spoken of successor kings as their “sons.” Alternate translation: “his successors”

**"a beam shall be pulled from his house, and, being erect, he shall be impaled on it"**

This is an implicit reference to one form of capital punishment that the Persians used. Darius assumes that the officials know what he means. Anyone who violates his order is to be lifted up and impaled on a beam of wood from his own house. That is, one end of the beam is to be sharpened so that it will pass through the body of the offender, the other end is to be planted in the ground, and he is to be impaled on the beam. Alternate translation: “pull a beam out of his house, sharpen one end, and lift him up and impale him on it”

Darius speaks of God’s **name** here as if it were capable of living in a place. The phrase echoes Jewish usage, which Darius may be following deliberately to show his respect for the God whose temple he wants to be rebuilt. The phrase indicates that Jerusalem is the place from which God chose to start making himself known throughout the world.

**"and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, the king of Persia"**

Here, the book assumes some knowledge on the part of readers, because by this point in time, only King Cyrus ([1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:2-Ezra1:4)) and King Darius ([6:6–12](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:6-Ezra6:12)) had issued decrees for the Jerusalem temple to be rebuilt. Artaxerxes was the grandson of Darius, and he would not become king for another 50 years. Moreover, while the book anticipated the reign of Artaxerxes in [4:7–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:7-Ezra4:23), there it recounted how he ordered the temple rebuilding to stop. But the book is assuming that readers will know that Artaxerxes eventually did reverse himself and issue a decree for the maintenance of the Jerusalem temple. The book describes this in [7:12–26](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:12-Ezra7:26). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly.

## Ezra 6:19 (#5) (id: 463145)

**"on day 14 of the first month"**

The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, **14**, but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, fourteenth, in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the fourteenth day of the first month”

## Ezra 6:19 (#6) (id: 463146)

**"on day 14 of the first month"**

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the numbers of the Hebrew day and month. Alternate translation: “on the fourteenth day of the first month”

**"on day 14 of the first month"**

This means the first month of the following year. Since Adar is the last month in the Jewish calendar, this was only a few weeks after the temple was finished. The implication is that the Jewish leaders had been able to complete that work and install the priests and Levites in time to celebrate this festival. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “only a few weeks later, on the fourteenth day of the first month”

**"Then they performed the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy"**

**Festival of Unleavened Bread** is the name of another religious festival that the law of Moses commanded the Jews to celebrate every year to remember how God had rescued their ancestors from slavery in Egypt. The term **Unleavened Bread** refers to bread that is made without yeast or other leavening. When God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, he told them to flee quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. Unleavened bread is served in the yearly Passover meal in remembrance of that time. Then for the next week after Passover, the Jews are still not to eat any leavened bread. The beginning and end of that week are marked by special ceremonies. Alternate translation: “For the next seven days, they joyfully celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread”

This sentence has three main parts, each one giving the reason for what comes before it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could break the sentence into three sentences, and put the earlier part about the festival at the end. In that way, each sentence gives the result of the sentence before it.

## Ezra - Chapter 7 Introduction (id: 718620)

Ezra 7 General Notes
====================

Structure and formatting
------------------------

### Possible title: Ezra begins his religious reforms

### Ezra's geneology

Ezra’s genealogy in [7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:5) traces Ezra back to Aaron in a list of 16 ancestors. As is common in ancient genealogies, this list almost certainly does not include all of the generations between Aaron and Ezra. Aaron ([7:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:5)) was the first high priest under the law of Moses and the first to serve in the tabernacle. Azariah ([7:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:3)) was the first high priest to serve in the temple that Solomon built, which this book describes in [5:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:11). Seraiah was the last high priest to serve in that temple. The Babylonians executed him when they conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple. The names in the list are arranged so that there will be seven generations between Aaron and Azariah, and seven generations between Azariah and Ezra, with Seraiah listed as the last generation before Ezra. If you have the freedom to use formatting creatively in your translation, you could make the implicit information about Aaron, Azariah, and Seraiah explicit and format this genealogy in a way that will highlight its purpose and design. Alternate translation and formatting for verse 1 through the first 2 words of verse 6:

Ezra—

the descendant of Seraiah, the last high priest in Solomon’s temple, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the descendant of Ahitub, the descendant of Amariah,

the son of Azariah, the first high priest in Solomon’s temple,

the descendant of Meraioth, the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,

the son of Aaron, the first high priest in the tabernacle

—this Ezra

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### God’s Law

The people no longer know the law of Moses. Therefore, the king allows Ezra to return to Judea to teach the people about God’s law. Many people go with him. (See: Law of Moses)

* **Associated Articles:** Law of Moses (ID: 26817)

## Ezra 7:1 (#1) (id: 463170)

**"Now after these things"**

This phrase, common in Hebrew storytelling, indicates that the book will now relate events that occurred some time after the events that it had been describing. The book had been describing the time when the Jews finished rebuilding the temple, [6:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:15), which was the sixth year of the reign of Darius. Now it will describe events beginning during the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, who was the grandson of Darius. So nearly sixty years went by between the end of chapter 6 and the beginning of chapter 7\. If your language has a similar phrase that can indicate the passage of time like this, you can use that in your translation.

## Ezra 7:1 (#3) (id: 463172)

**"Ezra"**

Here the book introduces a new, important person. Use a natural way in your language to do this. Also, since the sentence that begins here extends through verse 6, it may be helpful to your readers to make this first part of verse 1 into a complete sentence and begin another sentence with the list of Ezra's ancestors, as in the UST.

## Ezra 7:1 (#4) (id: 463173)

**"the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah"**

In general, in the list in [7:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:5), **son** means descendant. However, in many cases a man actually is the biological son of the next man on the list. So for your translation, you will need to decide whether to use the figurative expression **son**, which can also be literally true in many cases, or the plain expression “descendant,” which is true in every case, or to say “son” for actual sons and “descendant” for descendants who are not actual sons. Choosing that last option would help to show that the men on the list have been selected to make a certain number and arrangement, as explained in the chapter introduction. Alternative translations will illustrate this last option for each verse. Here, Alternate translation: “the descendant of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah”

**"in year seven of Artaxerxes the king"**

The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, **seven**, but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, **seventh**, in similar contexts elsewhere.

**"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month"**

The **fifth month** means the fifth month in the Jewish calendar. You could convert the Hebrew month into an equivalent on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the equivalency will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate.

The first part ([7:14–16](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:14-Ezra7:16)) provides the reasons for the second part (in [7:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:17)). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could break up that sentence into several smaller sentences. To begin with, you could make this verse a sentence of its own. To do that, you could leave off the word **Because** and express the meaning later in verse 17 with a word such as “so” or “therefore.” Alternate translation: “The king and his seven counselors are sending you to inquire about Judah and about Jerusalem by the law of your God which is in your hand.”

This phrase would show anyone who read the letter that Ezra was an important figure in the royal court.

Artaxerxes is describing the Jews who are in the province of Judah, and especially its capital city of Jerusalem, figuratively, by reference to things that are associated with them, the province and city where they live.

The phrase **in your hand** could mean that Ezra literally carried a scroll of the law in his hands or that he personally owned a written copy of the law. However, the phrase **in your hand** could also imply that Ezra will use the law as he performs his responsibilities in Judah and Jerusalem.

**"whose dwelling is in Jerusalem"**

Artaxerxes speaks of the God of Israel as if he actually lived in Jerusalem. Like Darius in [6:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:12), he seems to be echoing Jewish usage, likely to show his respect for the God of Israel. The phrase indicates that Jerusalem is the place from which God chose to start making himself known throughout the world. In this context it seems to refer specifically to the temple since, in the next verse, Artaxerxes associates the silver and gold that he and his counselors have given with further gifts that others may give for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.

**"with all the silver and the gold that you find in all the province of Babylon"**

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could also divide this verse into two sentences. This phrase could be the first sentence. Here, **find** is an idiom that in this context means “can obtain.” Artaxerxes is giving Ezra permission to invite everyone in the province of Babylon to contribute.

**"with all the silver and the gold that you find in all the province of Babylon"**

The implication is that these would be contributions towards the expenses of the worship of Yahweh in the temple in Jerusalem, just like the gifts described in the rest of the verse. The further implication is that, just as the king and his counselors were sympathetic to the Jews in Jerusalem and eager to please the “God of heaven” ([7:23](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:23)), others in the province might be eager to do so as well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly.

## Ezra 7:16 (#5) (id: 463246)

**"along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests who freely give for the house of God, which is in Jerusalem"**

If you have chosen to divide this verse into two sentences, this can be the second sentence. Here, **the people** means the people of Israel, as in [7:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:13). Alternate translation: “I also authorize you to collect any offerings that the people of Israel and their priests want to give freely for the temple in Jerusalem.”

## Ezra 7:16 (#6) (id: 463247)

**"which is in Jerusalem"**

**"therefore"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nThe word **therefore** introduces the final part of the long sentence in [7:14–17](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:14-Ezra7:17). It indicates the results of the reasons that the sentence has given so far. You can translate it with the word or phrase in your language that introduces the result of a list of reasons. However, if you have followed the suggestion to break up this long sentence into several shorter sentences, you may not need to represent that meaning here.

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nThe implication is that this means not just the gifts from the priests and Israelites, but also the gifts from the king, his counselors, and the people of the province of Babylon.

## Ezra 7:17 (#3) (id: 463250)

**"diligently you shall buy"** \- **"bulls, rams, lambs, and their grain offerings and their drink offerings"**

The implication, as [6:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:9) indicates explicitly, is that the bulls, rams, and lambs were to be used for whole burnt offerings. If it would be helpful, review the note to [3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2) about what whole burnt offerings were and why they were offered. The book also expects readers to know that the law of Moses said that two further things should be offered together with the animals that were sacrificed in whole burnt offerings. One was a certain amount of flour mixed with oil, considered a **grain offering**. The other was a certain amount of wine, considered a **drink offering**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “be sure to buy bulls, rams, and lambs to sacrifice as whole burnt offerings, and grain, oil, and wine for the grain offerings and drink offerings that the law says must accompany them”

**"diligently"**

In their decrees, as several examples in this book show, the Persian kings used this term **diligently** to mean carefully, exactly, and efficiently. Review the note to [5:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:8) about this term if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “be sure that”

Here, **brother** is a figurative way of saying “fellow Israelites,” and in context it likely refers to the other Jewish leaders who would decide with Ezra what to do with the extra money. Alternate translation: “You and your fellow Jewish leaders can decide what you think your God would like you to do with any silver and gold that is left over.”

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nThis sentence may be introducing a contrast between what Ezra and the other Jewish leaders could do with gold and silver that people contributed in the form of money and what they had to do with gold and silver that people contributed in the form of bowls and other objects that could be used in the temple. You could begin the sentence with a word such as “however” to indicate this contrast.

## Ezra 7:19 (#2) (id: 463260)

**"And the vessels that were given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem"**

As in [1:7](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:7), **vessels** refers to bowls, basins, and other objects that could be used in worship in the temple. The ones that people contributed on this occasion are described in more detail in [8:26–27](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:26-Ezra8:27). The implication in what the king says here is that Ezra and the Jewish leaders are not to sell or melt down these objects and use the proceeds to pay for temple expenses. Rather, they must use these objects only for temple worship. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Do not use objects that people contribute for use in the temple of your God to pay for the temple expenses. Make sure that you deliver every one of them to Jerusalem, where they can be used in God’s presence”

## Ezra 7:19 (#5) (id: 463263)

**"deliver in full"**

The Aramaic expression translated here as **deliver in full** means to “make complete.” It is the same one that the Jewish leaders use in [5:16](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:16) when they say that the temple is not “finished” yet. In context it means that Ezra must be sure to deliver every single one of the contributed objects to the temple, so that the complete set that was donated will be reassembled there. (We see him doing this carefully in [8:26–27](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:26-Ezra8:27)). Alternate translation: “make sure that you deliver every one of them”

**"And the rest of what is needed for the house of your God that falls to you to give"**

## Ezra 7:20 (#4) (id: 463269)

**"you may give from the house of the treasures of the king"**

This does not mean, as in [5:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:17), the place where valuable royal documents were stored. Here, **house** likely represents all of the wealth of the king figuratively. It is a metaphor for “property,” meaning everything that a person keeps in his house, and by extension everything that he owns. So it is not necessarily a physical building, but it refers in general to all the financial resources that belong to the king, as with the shorter expression **the treasures of the king** in [6:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:8). Alternate translation: “you may pay for from my royal treasury”

Specifically, Artaxerxes has just said that Ezra may pay for additional expenses out of the royal treasury. Consequently, regarding providing funds to Ezra, he will now give instructions to the officials responsible for administering the royal revenue in the province where Jerusalem is located.

**"And from me myself, Artaxerxes the king, is set a decree"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nUp to this point in the letter, Artaxerxes has been addressing Ezra, and he has spoken of himself mostly in the third person. But now as he turns to address a new audience, the royal treasurers, he speaks of himself in the first person, and he uses the emphatic form **me myself** and repeats his name and title, as in [7:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:12). If you have been translating the king’s use of the third person for himself in this letter with the first person in your language, it may be helpful to your readers if you use some emphatic form or extended phrase here to show this transition.

Here, the king is speaking in an abbreviated, official way, and the connection to the previous verse may not be entirely clear for all readers. He is describing how much he is authorizing Ezra to ask for from the treasury in money and supplies. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, and you could also make this verse a sentence of its own. Alternate translation: “I am authorizing Ezra to ask you treasurers for up to 100 kikkars of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and an unlimited amount of salt.”

**"100 silver kikkars"**

You could try to express the modern value of this amount of silver. But since prices vary over time, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. So you could express the amount instead using the ancient measurement, the kikkar, and explain in a note that this was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does.

Once again, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the quantity in modern measurements, or you could express the amount using the ancient measurement and explain its modern equivalent in a footnote.

**"For why should there be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons"**

The king is making a statement, not asking a real question. He does not expect the treasurers to explain to him why there should be wrath against the kingdom. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for the treasurers to ensure that sufficient funds are provided so that worship in the temple can be conducted just as God has commanded, so that God will not be angry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement.

(If it would be helpful, also review the notes to [4:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:15) and [6:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:10) about how Persian kings considered their predecessors their “fathers” and their successors their **sons**.)

**"there is no authority to set tax, tribute, or custom upon all the priests, and the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the temple servants, and the servants of that house of God"**

The last phrase, **the servants of that house of God**, describes what the people in the five groups listed all have in common. They all work in the temple of God. In this way, the phrase gives the reason why the treasurers may not impose taxes on anyone in any of these groups. Likely as a further way of supporting the temple, and perhaps also as a gesture of respect for God, Artaxerxes is providing an exemption from taxes for all temple personnel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this reason before the results that the rest of the sentence describes. Alternate translation: “because the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants all work in the temple of this God, you have no authority to set any tax, tribute, or custom upon them”

## Ezra 7:25 (#1) (id: 463299)

**"And as for you, Ezra"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nThe king now returns to address Ezra personally, so **you** refers to him here, and is singular, The three instances of **your** in this verse are also singular, as is the verb **appoint**. Only the phrase **you shall teach** is plural, referring to Ezra and to those whom he will appoint. If your language distinguishes between levels of social status, the form for a superior addressing a respected individual would be appropriate.

**"that is in your hand"**

Most likely, the phrase **that is in your hand** here means the same thing as in [7:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:14), where the law of God is described as being in Ezra's hand. Review the note there if that would be helpful. As there, the phrase **in your hand** here could mean: (1\) that Ezra knows it and uses it with great ability. Alternate translation: “that you know and use well” or (2\) that Ezra personally owns a scroll of God's wisdom. Alternate translation: “that you have with you”

**"appoint magistrates and judges who may judge"**

The terms **magistrates** and **judges** mean very similar things. There are two possibilities here. (1\) Artaxerxes could be using these two terms to refer to people in slightly different roles. The first term may refer to officials who decide disputes between people, and the second term may refer to officials who interpret the law and apply it to specific situations. Alternate translation: “appoint officials who can decide disputes between people and officials who can interpret and apply the law” or (2\) Artaxerxes may be using the two words together to emphasize the authority that Ezra has to ensure that the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem follow God’s commandments. If you have only one term for these functions, you can just use that one term here. Alternate translation: “appoint judges so that they can judge”

The second phrase clarifies the meaning of the first phrase, showing that Artaxerxes is referring specifically to the Jews who live in this province. He is allowing the Jews there to have their own legal system, based on the law of Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly.

**"And everyone who will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, judgment shall be exacted from him diligently"**

The implication is that the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem will still be governed by Persian law in addition to the law of Moses, but Artaxerxes is giving Ezra the authority to appoint judges who will administer and enforce both sets of laws. In this way, members of the Jewish community will have Jewish judges. Alternate translation: “The judges you appoint are diligently to punish anyone who refuses to obey the law of your God or my decrees”

## Ezra 7:27 (#1) (id: 463311)

**"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nPreviously in the book, Ezra has been a character in a story that someone else has been telling. Here he becomes the person telling the story, and he continues to tell it through to the end of chapter 9\. In effect, the letter of introduction that King Artaxerxes wrote for him has been his introduction to us as well. The book does not say specifically that Ezra will now be the narrator, although one indication is that when Ezra is telling the story, he refers to himself as “I” and to the Jewish community as “us,” and another indication is that the book is now written in Hebrew again. But if it would be helpful to your readers, you could add a phrase to indicate this. Alternate translation: “When I, Ezra, received this letter from the king, I prayed, ‘Thank you, Yahweh, the God of our ancestors’”

**"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers"**

Connecting Statement:\\n\\nThe first thing that Ezra does when he begins to tell his own story is pray to God, rather than address the audience that will hear his story. If you decided to add a phrase to introduce him as the new narrator, you could use that same phrase to introduce this prayer as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “When I, Ezra, received this letter from the king, I prayed, ‘Thank you, Yahweh, the God of our ancestors’” Otherwise, you could show that this prayer is distinct from the story by setting it off with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. The quotation should end in the middle of [7:28](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:28), after “the mighty officials of the king.”

**"gave according to this in the heart of the king, to glorify the house of Yahweh, which is in Jerusalem"**

Giving something in the king’s heart, that is, putting something in it, means leading him to have certain thoughts and desires. Alternate translation: “led the king to want to glorify the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem”

## Ezra 7:27 (#7) (id: 463317)

**"to glorify the house of Yahweh"**

This expression means to make something bright, glorious, or beautiful. Artaxerxes was not doing this literally, the way that Cyrus and Darius did by supporting the physical rebuilding of the temple. Rather, Artaxerxes was making sure that the temple would always have everything it needed to keep operating. In that way he was making sure that the temple would not languish and be disrespected, but rather, always be a vibrant place that was held in honor. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to honor the temple of Yahweh” or “to make sure that the temple of Yahweh would always be a glorious place”

**"and caused covenant faithfulness to extend to me before the face of the king, and his counselors, and before all the mighty officials of the king"**

Here, the abstract noun **faithfulness** refers to a person wanting to do everything that they can to help another person. As in [3:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:11), **covenant faithfulness** refers specifically to Yahweh doing that for the people of Israel in order to keep the promises that he had made to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as **help**. Alternate translation: “and helped me get everything I needed from the king, as I was in his presence and in the presence of his counselors and mighty officials”

As [7:8–9](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:8-Ezra7:9) indicates, this was specifically in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “during the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes as king of Persia.”

## Ezra 8:3 (#1) (id: 463336)

**""from the sons of Shecaniah. From the sons of Parosh: Zechariah""**

This could mean one of two things. (1\) The phrase **from the sons of Shecaniah** probably applies to the end of the previous verse. 1 Chronicles 3:19–22 shows that Hattush was the grandson of Shecaniah, and that Shecaniah was either the grandson or a more distant descendant of Zerubbabel, who was a descendant of King David. (As several of the following verses show, further information like this may be provided about the clan leaders on this list.) So the end of [8:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:2) and the beginning of [8:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:3) could read: “From the descendants of King David, Hattush, one of the descendants of Shecaniah” or (2\) It could mean that Zechariah was the clan leader of the descendants of Shecaniah, and that they were all descendants of a more remote ancestor named Parosh.

Since this list has been providing the name of each clan leader, it would be unusual for it to omit the leader’s name here and state only the name of his father. Most scholars believe that the name of the clan leader was accidentally left out at one point in the copying process. Other ancient versions of the Old Testament read, “from the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could follow those versions and include the following footnote: “The name Zattu appears in the ancient Greek and other ancient versions.” Alternate translation: “From the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel” If you want to translate only what is in the Hebrew, you could follow the ULT or translate, “From the descendants of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel”

As in [8:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:5), it appears that the name of the clan was accidentally left out at one point in the copying process for this verse. Since this list has been providing the name of each clan leader, it would be unusual for it to omit the leader’s name here and state only the name of his father. Other ancient versions of the Old Testament in Greek say here, “from the descendants of Bani, Shelomith the son of Josiphiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could follow those versions and include the following footnote: “The name Bani appears in ancient Greek versions.” Alternate translation: “From the descendants of Bani, Shelomith the son of Josiphiah” If you want to translate only what is in the Hebrew, you could follow the ULT or translate, “And from the descendants of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah”

**Them** means everyone listed in [8:2–14](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:2-Ezra8:14), everyone who would be traveling with Ezra. The implication is that they all packed for the trip and set out from their homes, but then assembled at a location outside of the city of Babylon where Ezra could make sure the group was ready for the trip. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I had everyone who was going to be traveling with me assemble on the banks of the river that flows from Babylon to Ahava.

**"And I examined the people and the priests, but I did not find there any from the sons of Levi"**

Here, we learn that one purpose of this preliminary encampment was for Ezra to see whether he had all the temple personnel that he needed. The implication behind this statement is that Ezra looked over the whole group to make sure of this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. (We learn in [8:25](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:25) that a further purpose of the encampment was to make arrangements for the safe transportation of the money and objects that had been donated for the temple.)

## Ezra 8:16 (#3) (id: 463382)

**"the heads"**

Unlike in [7:28](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:28), here this expression does not mean heads of father’s houses, that is, clan leaders. Rather, **heads** here has a more general meaning and is simply a figurative way of saying “leaders.” None of these nine men, with the possible exception of Zechariah, are among the clan leaders listed in [8:2–14](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:2-Ezra8:14). (And considering that three of the men whom Ezra summoned were named Elnathan, which shows that several individuals could share the same name, it is quite possible that this is a different Zechariah from either the one named in [8:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:3) or the one named in [8:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:11).)

**"men of understanding"**

This phrase suggests that while Joiarib and Elnathan were not community leaders like the other nine men, Ezra sent them anyway to help recruit more temple personnel because they were wise and reasonable and could be persuasive.

**"Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants in the place Kasiphia"**

Here, **brothers** is a figurative way of referring to people who belonged to groups that could serve in the temple, as Iddo did. (It is possible that some of his biological brothers are also included in this term.) In context, Iddo is a Levite leader, while the **brothers** are said to include **temple servants**, so the term indicates both groups.

**"from the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, even Sherebiah"**

**Sons** means “descendants” in reference to Mahli, since he was a distant ancestor of the group that Sherebiah belonged to. The word **son** means “descendant” when applied to Levi, since Mahli was actually his grandson. But Levi actually was the biological son of Israel.

**"and his sons and his brothers were 18"**

Since this was a small group of related people, it is quite possible that it consisted largely, if not entirely, of Sherebiah’s actual sons and brothers. So you could, in your translation, decide to treat the terms as literal. On the other hand, they could also be figurative, with **sons** meaning “descendants” and **brothers** meaning “relatives.” Alternate translation: “along with 18 of his sons and brothers” or “along with 18 of his descendants and relatives”

## Ezra 8:23 (#5) (id: 463430)

**"and he was entreated by us"**

As is clear from the way this expression is used elsewhere in the Bible, it means that God answered a prayer. For example, Genesis 25:21 says, “Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife because she could not have children, and Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.” However, since Ezra does not describe until [8:32](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:32) how the group arrived safely in Jerusalem, the prayer had not yet been answered at this point in the story. So an alternative meaning in context would be that the group received assurance that God would answer their prayer. Alternate translation: “and he answered our prayer” or “and we felt assured that he would answer our prayer”

## Ezra 8:24 (#2) (id: 463432)

**"Then I separated 12 from the leaders of the priests to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten from their brothers"**

The Hebrew text is difficult here. One way to read it is: “Then I separated 12 from the leaders of the priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten from their brothers.” But since [8:18](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:18) and [19](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:19) specifically identify Sherebiah and Hashabiah as Levites, they could not have been leaders of the priests. An ancient Greek version of the book of Ezra says “and” before Sherebiah, so that this is a list of 24 men in total. Another way to read the Hebrew is as in the ULT, which also results in a list of 24 men. Both of these translations agree with [8:30](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:30), which says that “the priests and the Levites” received the silver and gold and objects that Ezra weighed out to them. It will likely be clearest for your readers if you translate the verse in one of the latter two ways. Alternate translation: “Then I selected 12 leaders of the priests, along with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their fellow Levites.”

**"And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels"**

Ezra says he **weighed out** the money to the priests and Levites because ancient units of money such as the kikkar and the daric were actually units of the weight of precious metals. The value of the gold and silver objects would similarly have depended on their weight. Alternate translation: “I divided up the silver and gold and objects into 24 portions of equal value and gave one to each of the priests and Levites whom I had selected to transport them.”

**"650 kikkars of silver, and vessels of silver of 100 kikkars, 100 kikkars of gold"**

Since prices of precious metals vary over time, if you tried to express the value here in modern money, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. Instead you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the kikkar, and explain in a note that a kikkar was equivalent to about 30 kilograms of weight. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does. Alternate translation: “650 kikkars of silver, silver objects weighing 100 kikkars, and 100 kikkars of gold”

The **first month** means the first month in the Jewish calendar. You could convert the Hebrew month into an equivalent on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the equivalency will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to use the number of the Hebrew month. Alternate translation: “on the twelfth day of the first month of that year”

## Ezra 8:31 (#4) (id: 463465)

**"on day 12 of the first month"**

The Hebrew uses a cardinal number here, **12**, but there is not a significant difference in meaning between that and the way the Hebrew uses an ordinal number, “twelfth,” in similar contexts elsewhere. If your language customarily uses ordinals for the numbers of days, you can do that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the twelfth day of the first month”

## Ezra 8:31 (#5) (id: 463466)

**"And the hand of our God was upon us"**

As in the expression **hand of our God upon us** in [8:18](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:18), **hand** here represents power and control. The expression indicates that God protected Ezra and the rest of the travelers on their journey. Alternate translation: “God protected us”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 8:31 (#6) (id: 463467)

**"our God"**

In this case, Ezra is using **our** in the inclusive sense, that is, it includes the reader, since he is reporting his trip to fellow believers in God. Alternate translation: “the God to whom we all belong”

## Ezra 8:31 (#7) (id: 463468)

**"and he delivered us from the palm of the enemy and ambush on the way"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra essentially says the same thing twice to emphasize how carefully God protected this group that was transporting so much treasure. If saying nearly the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “and God protected us from any robbers along the way” However, you could also choose to bring out the slight difference in meaning. The first phrase is more general, and the second phrase describes more specifically how someone might have robbed the group. Alternate translation: “and God protected us and prevented any bandits who were hiding along the roadways from robbing us”

Ezra does not say specifically why the group waited for three days before delivering the silver and gold and objects to the temple. But the implication is that this gave them a chance to rest after their journey and arrange for the delivery. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly.

This means that the objects and the bars or coins of silver and gold were both counted and weighed.

## Ezra 8:35 (#4) (id: 463486)

**"offered burnt up offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats of a sin offering. The whole was a burnt up offering to Yahweh"**

The book assumes that readers will recognize that there are two types of offerings here. The bulls, rams, and lambs are offerings of the first type. They were offered in order to express a desire to be in good standing with God by creating an aroma, the smell of roasting meat, that was considered to be pleasing to God. These were completely burned up. The goats are the second type of offering. As in [6:17](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:17), the goats were a **sin offering**. These were offered as a request for forgiveness from God. As explained in Leviticus 4:22–26 and 6:24–30, only the fat of these goats was burned up. The meat of these goats was for the priests to eat. The phrase **The whole was a burnt up offering** is a summary that includes the two types of offerings, one that was completely burned up and the other that was partially burned up. Therefore the final sentence means, “All of this was properly subjected to fire on the altar as sacrifices to Yahweh.” The book assumes that readers know this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “offered as burnt offerings to the God of Israel 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs, and as a sin offering 12 male goats. All of these sacrifices were offered to Yahweh through fire on the altar”

**"offered burnt up offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats of a sin offering"**

The numbers of animals offered are symbolic, as the book explains in the case of the bulls. There were 12 bulls **for all Israel** because there were twelve tribes of Israel. There were 12 goats for the same reason. The same symbolism seems to lie behind the 96 rams, since that number is eight times 12, although the significance of the number eight is no longer apparent. The number 77 is an intensive form of the number seven, which symbolizes completeness. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “offered 12 bulls, one for each of the tribes of Israel, 96 rams, eight for each of the tribes of Israel, and 77 lambs, expressing completeness, as burnt offerings to the God of Israel, and 12 male goats as a sin offering, one for each of the tribes of Israel”

**"And they gave the laws of the king to the satraps of the king and the governors of Beyond\-the\-River"**

Here, **the laws of the king** seem to mean the decrees that Artaxerxes issued in the letter he gave to Ezra, and specifically the provisions that allowed Ezra to ask for support for the temple, exempted temple personnel from taxation, and allowed Ezra to appoint judges. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly.

The word **satraps** refers to rulers appointed by the king to rule over his provinces, such as the province of Beyond\-the\-River in which Judah was located. The **governors** were lower officials who worked in the province under the direction of the satrap. Use the words that communicate this best in your language.

## Ezra - Chapter 9 Introduction (id: 718622)

Ezra 9 General Notes
====================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Intermarriage

When Ezra found out that many Jews who had returned from exile had married Gentile wives, he prayed to God and confessed this sin of his people. He acknowledged that God had been good to them much more than they deserved by letting these few people return from captivity and then they sinned by marrying Gentile wives. The Jewish people had done this before and God had punished them for it. God forbade this type of marriage because it caused the people to worship other gods. (See: Sin and False God)

### Exclusive forms

Ezra uses many first person plural pronouns as he prays to God. Since Ezra is speaking to God, these forms of “we,” “us,” and “our” would all be the exclusive forms. (See: Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’)

* **Associated Articles:** False God (ID: 26586); Sin (ID: 27098); Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ (ID: 33271)

## Ezra 9:1 (#1) (id: 463492)

**"Now as soon as these things were finished"**

This phrase indicates that the events the story will now relate came right after the events it has just described. In your translation, you can use the expression in your language that would best indicate this relationship.

See: Connect — Sequential Time Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 9:1
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Sequential Time Relationship (ID: 33333)

## Ezra 9:1 (#2) (id: 463493)

**"Now as soon as"** \- **"were finished"**

The word **now** introduces a new event in the story. If your language has a word or expression for introducing a new event, use that here.

* **Associated Articles:** Introduction of a New Event (ID: 33419)

## Ezra 9:1 (#3) (id: 463494)

**"the leaders"**

These appear to be the same **leaders** as in [8:29](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:29), that is, clan leaders. But this is not a reference to all of them, since the ones who come to Ezra say that some of their fellow leaders have married foreign women. Alternate translation: “some of the clan leaders”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Ezra 9:1 (#4) (id: 463495)

**"came to me, saying"**

After this phrase Ezra begins to quote what these clan leaders told him. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation.

## Ezra 9:1 (#5) (id: 463496)

**"have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands"**

Separation here is a spatial metaphor for behavior. As in [6:21](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:21), it means to refuse to do the same things as another group. Alternate translation: “have not refused to do the things that the other people groups living in the land do”

**"from the peoples of the lands according to their abominations"**

While the similar phrase in [6:21](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:21) spoke of “uncleanness,” that is, things that God does not accept, the phrase here speaks of **abominations**, that is, things that are very displeasing to God. Alternate translation: “from the things that are very displeasing to God that the other people groups living in the land do”

## Ezra 9:2 (#1) (id: 463500)

**"For"**

Here, **For** indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the reasons for the statement that the leaders make in the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “You see,”

## Ezra 9:2 (#2) (id: 463501)

**"they have lifted from their daughters for themselves and for their sons"**

The phrase **lifted from their daughters** is an idiom that means “married some of their women.” Alternate translation: “Israelite men have married women from these other groups, and they have also gotten wives for their sons from those groups.”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Ezra 9:2 (#4) (id: 463503)

**"so they have mixed the seed of holiness with the peoples of the lands"**

The implication is that as a result of these marriages, not only was a distinct Jewish lineage being lost, the Jewish people were also beginning to follow the practices of these other groups rather than the commandments of God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “so they are blending the Jewish people right in with the other people groups living in the land, and they are starting to follow their practices rather than the law of God”

**"the seed of holiness"**

As in [8:28](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:28), **holiness** means “that which is set apart for a special purpose.” Here, the word refers specifically to the fact that God had set apart the Israelites to be a model community of God’s followers. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people, who belong to God,”

## Ezra 9:2 (#10) (id: 463509)

**"the leaders and the rulers"**

These terms mean similar things, but it seems that **leaders** may refer to the heads of the clans and that **rulers** may refer to official leaders of government. If your language uses one word for both of those, you can combine them and use that word here. Alternate translation: “our chiefs”

**"in this unfaithfulness"**

This is the end of Ezra’s quotation of what the clan leaders told him. If you decided in [9:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1) to mark their words as a direct quotation, you should indicate that here with a closing primary quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation.

## Ezra 9:3 (#1) (id: 463511)

**"I tore my garment and my robe. And I pulled out some from the hair of my head and my beard, and I sat down appalled"**

By performing these actions, Ezra was demonstrating symbolically how serious a wrong the Israelites had committed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to show how wrong it was for the Israelites to have married foreign women, I tore my tunic and my cloak, I pulled out some hair from my head and my beard, and I sat down stunned”

**"appalled"**

The sense of this word is that Ezra was so overwhelmed with shock and horror that he did not move or speak. In your translation, you can use the expression in your language that would best indicate this. Alternate translation: “stunned” or “devastated”

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 9:3

## Ezra 9:4 (#1) (id: 463513)

**"And all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles were gathered to me"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Everyone came and joined me who was just as distressed as I was about the way the Jews who had returned from exile had disobeyed the commandments of the God of Israel”

## Ezra 9:4 (#2) (id: 463514)

**"all who trembled"**

Often in the Old Testament, **trembled** is a metaphor meaning to regard someone or something with respect and reverential fear. That is likely included in the meaning here, but in this context, the expression also seems to indicate an actual physical response to the situation, just as Ezra did not move or speak. Alternate translation: “everyone who was distressed”

**"at the words of the God of Israel"**

This phrase does not refer to something that God said on this occasion. Rather, it refers to the commandment that God had given to the Israelites earlier not to intermarry with foreign groups, which Ezra cites in his prayer in [9:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:10) and [9:11](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:11).

The abstract noun **exiles** refers in this context to the Jews who had returned to their homeland from Babylon. Here, **the exiles** seems to be equivalent to the longer phrase **the sons of the exile** in several other places in the book. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the idea behind this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “because of the way the Jews who had returned to their homeland had disobeyed”

## Ezra 9:5 (#1) (id: 463519)

**"I arose from my humilation, and when I tore my garment and my robe"**

Even though Ezra had been sitting down and he now got up, in this context the word **arise** means more than that. As in [1:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra1:5), [3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2), and [5:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:2), it means to take action to get an enterprise under way. Ezra had been sitting motionless to show how ashamed and upset he was. Now he began to take action to address the situation that the clan leaders had told him about. Alternate translation: “I stopped sitting motionless in my torn clothes and began to do something about the situation”

**"and when I tore my garment and my robe"**

As the note to [9:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:3) explains, Ezra had torn his clothes to show how wrong it was for the Israelites to have married foreign women. By not changing out of his torn clothes, Ezra was continuing to show that symbolically. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but I kept wearing my torn clothes to show how wrong it was for the Israelites to have married foreign women”

**"And I said"**

After this phrase Ezra begins to quote what he said out loud in prayer on this occasion. The quotation continues through [9:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:15).

**"to raise my face to you"**

## Ezra 9:6 (#5) (id: 463526)

**"For our iniquities have multiplied to above the head, and our guilt has grown up as far as to the heavens"**

These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra uses the repetition to emphasize how guilty the people of Israel are. If repeating the same thing twice would be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins that our guilt because of them is completely overwhelming us” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The first phrase speaks of the effects of these sins on the Israelites, while the second phrase speaks of their effects on their standing with God. Alternate translation: “We have committed such great sins that they are overwhelming us, and we know that they are making us guilty before you”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this sentence first in the prayer (after **My God**), since it gives the reason for the result of Ezra feeling ashamed. You could show the connection by using a word like “so” after this phrase. Alternate translation: “we have committed such great sins that we are completely guilty, and we know that we are very guilty before you. And so”

Here, Ezra speaks of God by reference to something associated with him, **the heavens**, which was considered to be the place where God lived. The expression **and our guilt has grown up as far as to the heavens** means that the sins have become so numerous that the pile of them has reached to God in heaven. In other words, their sin is against God himself. Alternate translation: “and our many sins have made us very guilty before you”

These two phrases mean similar things. Ezra says essentially the same thing twice, probably to emphasize how remarkable this was after all the opposition that there had been to it. If repeating both phrases in your translation might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “and allowed us to rebuild the temple of our God” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase is stronger because it indicates that the temple had previously been destroyed but now it was being restored.

## Ezra 9:9 (#12) (id: 463575)

**"and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem"**

Ezra is not referring to a literal wall. (The walls of Jerusalem were still broken down at this time. They would not be repaired until Nehemiah came to the city over a dozen years later.) Rather, he means that the Persian kings authorized the returned exiles to re\-establish their community in Judah and Jerusalem, and so the king would protect their right to live there. It is as if the Jews are already protected by this as though by a wall. Alternate translation: “and has given us a safe place to live in Judah and Jerusalem.”

## Ezra 9:10 (#1) (id: 463576)

**"So now, our God, what can we say after this"**

Ezra is making a statement, not really asking a question. He does not expect God to tell him what excuses he can give for the disobedience of the Israelites. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Israelites really have no excuses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “So now, our God, we really have no excuses, after all of this.”

**"after this"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain what **this** refers to. There are two possibilities. (1\) It probably refers to all of the sinning that the Jews did by disobeying God. Alternate translation: “after we have continued to sin against you” or (2\) It could refer to the good things that God did for the Jews even though they continually disobeyed him. Alternate translation: “after you have been much more kind to us than we deserved”

**"saying"**

After this phrase Ezra begins to quote what the prophets commanded the people on Yahweh’s behalf. So this is a quotation within a quotation. That is, Ezra is quoting the prayer that he prayed on this occasion, and within that prayer, he is quoting what the prophets said. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off these words within secondary quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation.

**"is a land of impurity by the impurity of the peoples of the lands"**

## Ezra 9:11 (#6) (id: 463584)

**"by their abominations that have filled it from mouth to mouth with their uncleanness"**

The term **abominations**, like the term **impurity**, refers to things that people do that are very displeasing to God. As in [9:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1), the term indicates that God must judge these actions as wrong, that is, as not in accordance with his own character. The prophets speak of these things as if they were accumulating physically and filling up the land. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Throughout the land, from one end to the other, they have been doing things that are very displeasing to God”

**"from mouth to mouth"**

**"nor shall you seek their peace or their good"**

**"so that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land"** \- **"it"**

These two phrases mean similar things. The prophets say essentially the same thing twice, to emphasize the blessings that the Israelites would enjoy if they obeyed these commandments. If repeating both phrases might be confusing for your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “so that you will become a prosperous nation in that place” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase says more specifically how the nation would become strong, as the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “so that you will become a strong nation by growing and enjoying abundant harvests”

**"so that you may be strong"**

The forms of **you** and **your** in this verse are plural, referring to all the Jewish people. Therefore **you may be strong** does not refer to a person's physical strength or health, but rather to the strength of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “so that your nation will be strong”

Ezra is making a statement, not really asking a question. He does not expect God to tell him whether the people should once again disobey. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for them to stop intermarrying with the other people groups. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or as an exclamation.

Ezra 10 General Notes
=====================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Intermarriages

In this chapter, Jewish men agree to divorce their Gentile wives. Divorce should not have been a common practice for the Jews, but they did it at this time because marriage between Jewish men and non\-Jewish women was not allowed.

* **Associated Passages:** EZR 10:1

## Ezra 10:1 (#1) (id: 463612)

**"And when Ezra prayed"**

Previously in the book, Ezra was a character in a story that someone else was telling. Then starting from [7:27](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:27) he is the person telling the story, and he continues to tell it through to the end of chapter 9\. Now from here to the end of the book, the story changes back to someone else talking about Ezra as a character in the story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could continue to translate this chapter as though Ezra were telling it. Alternate translation: “And when I prayed”

**"and casting himself down before the face of the house of God"**

By **casting himself down** onto the ground in front of the temple, Ezra was symbolically pleading with God, who was considered to be present in the temple, the way a supplicant in this culture would get down with his face on the ground to plead with a powerful person.

**"and he went to the chamber of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib"**

As in [8:29](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:29), **chamber** means a room, and in context here it seems to refer similarly to one of the rooms in the temple. Eliashib was the high priest, and so it is probable that one of his family members would have had a room there. The book does not say why Ezra went to one of the rooms in the temple, but the implication is that he did so in order to meet further with the community leaders and make plans for the assembly that the following verses describe. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he went to one of the rooms in the temple, the one that belonged to Jehohanan the grandson of Eliashib, to meet further with the leaders to make plans to call an assembly of all the returned exiles”

**"He did not eat bread and he did not drink water, but was mourning on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes.

**"the sons of the exile"**

As indicated in [2:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:1) and [8:35](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:35), the phrase **the sons of the exile** refers specifically to the group of Jewish people who returned to the land of Judah from Babylon where King Nebuchadnezzar had taken them (or their ancestors) as captives many years earlier when he conquered Jerusalem.

**"all the men of Judah and Benjamin"**

Since the assembly included Israelites from other tribes (for example, the priests and the Levites, who were both from the tribe of Levi), the book is using the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (or their territory), to represent all of the Israelite tribes.

**"It was the ninth month, on 20 in the month"**

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate.

**"trembling on account of the matter and because of the rains"**

As elsewhere in the book, **trembling** here may be a metaphor for regarding someone or something with respect and reverential fear. However, the people were likely trembling literally because of the rain, that is, shaking with cold. So the book is either mixing figurative and literal uses of the same term, or the people were literally shaking because they were all being called to account for a serious disobedience.

**"However"**

The people were all shouting their agreement with Ezra in verse 12, but now in verses 13 and 14 it seems that one person speaks on behalf of the group, rather than all of them shouting this together. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this change of speaker, as in the UST. If you do this, you may need to add a mark that indicates a closing quotation at the end of verse 12 and another mark that indicates an opening quotation before this word.

## Ezra 10:13 (#2) (id: 463691)

**"However"**

Here, **However** indicates a contrast between the previous verse and this verse. In the previous verse, the people agree that they need to fix this problem, but here they object that they cannot do it immediately. Use whatever form is most natural in your language to show this contrast.

**"and the time is rain showers and there is no strength to stand in the outdoors"**

If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes.

**"it concerns this matter"**

After this phrase, the book ends its quotation of what the assembly replied to Ezra on this occasion. If you decided in [10:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:12) to mark their words as a quotation, you should indicate their ending here with a closing quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation.

## Ezra 10:15 (#1) (id: 463703)

**"Only"**

The word **only** indicates that the sentence it introduces makes an exception from the larger group that was mentioned before. In [10:12](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:12) it appeared that the whole group was in agreement, but now we find out that there were four men who did not agree. Use a natural way to indicate this contrast that makes it clear that there were two men who opposed the idea, then two more joined them in opposing the idea. Alternate translation: “But a few, namely,”

**"Jonathan,"** \- **"and Jahzeiah,"** \- **"stood against this. And Meshullam and Shabbethai"** \- **"supported them"**

The implication is that while these four men spoke up in the assembly against investigating who among the Israelites had married foreign wives, their protests were unsuccessful. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jonathan … and Jahzeiah … did not want the community to investigate who had married foreign women. And Meshullam and Shabbethai … supported them, but they were not able to convince the assembly” Alternatively, you could express this idea at the beginning of verse 16\.

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate.

**"And there were women among them, and they bore sons"**

The implication is that if a foreign wife had borne children, the Israelite husband would send both the wife and her children away, as [10:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:3) describes.

Alternate translation: “Some of the foreign wives had borne children, and the men who had married them divorced them and sent away both them and their children.”

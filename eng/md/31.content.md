## Obadiah - Introduction (id: 718686)

Introduction to Obadiah
=======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of the Book of Obadiah

1. Yahweh will judge Edom (1:1–16\) A. Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:1–9\) B. Why Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:10–14\)
2. Yahweh will judge the nations (1:15–16\)
3. Yahweh will deliver his people (1:17–21\)

### What is the Book of Obadiah about?

After the nation of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, the Edomites (from the neighboring land of Edom) captured fleeing Jews. Then they gave these Jews over to Babylon. The Book of Obadiah is about Yahweh judging the Edomites for harming his people. This book would be comforting to the people of Judah who had been captured and forced to live in Babylon.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

This book is traditionally titled “The Book of Obadiah” or just “Obadiah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Sayings of Obadiah.” (See: How to Translate Names)

### Who wrote the Book of Obadiah?

The prophet Obadiah probably wrote this book. We know nothing more about Obadiah. His name in Hebrew means “Servant of Yahweh.”

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### What was Edom’s relationship to Israel?

Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel’s brother. This is because the Edomites descended from Esau, and the Israelites descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were twin brothers. This made Edom’s betrayal of Israel much worse. The notes also refer to the Israelites as the people of Judah. Judah was the part of Israel that had survived the earlier destruction by the nation of Assyria and that was later captured by the nation of Babylon when the nation of Edom did not help them.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### How do I translate the concept of “pride?”

The Book of Obadiah speaks of the pride of Edom. This meant that the Edomites thought that neither their enemies nor Yahweh could defeat them. (See: Proud)

### When Obadiah is addressing Edom, should I use a singular or plural form of “you?”

Since Obadiah addressed the people of Edom by referring to them as the nation of Edom, he used a singular form in the original language. But if you are using more plain language and want your translation to be clear that it is addressing the people of Edom, you could use a plural form.

## Obadiah 1:1 (#1) (id: 274307)

**"The vision of Obadiah"**

This is the title of the book. Here **vision** is used in the general sense of a message from Yahweh, rather than to indicate how Obadiah received that message. **Vision** here is a metaphor for the way that God gives knowledge to people. Alternate translation: “The message that God gave to Obadiah” or “The prophecy of Obadiah”

**"Obadiah"**

Some English translations call the prophet Abdias, but Obadiah is the form of his name most commonly used in English. Use the form of the name that is used in your source language or a form that is similar that sounds like a name in your language.

**"Behold, I am making you small"**

The addressee changes here. This is no longer Yahweh speaking to Judah or the messenger speaking to the other nations. Now Yahweh is speaking directly to the people of Edom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could add a quote introduction here, as in the UST.

**"how you are being destroyed"**

Yahweh adds this phrase in the middle of another sentence to express that the punishment of Edom is shocking. Unlike thieves and grape\-harvesters, those who attack Edom will leave nothing behind.

**"Esau"**

Here, the name **Esau** refers to the people of Edom. They were the descendants of Esau, who was also known as Edom. All the people of Edom are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. If this is confusing in your language, you can refer to the people instead, as in the UST.

**"All the men of your covenant are sending you away as far as the border"**

**"There is no understanding in him"**

This phrase could mean: (1\) Yahweh could be saying this as an aside in order to express his evaluation of the people of Edom. If this would be confusing in your language, you could continue the address to Edom in the second person, as in the UST. (2\) the former allies could be saying this about Edom.

## Obadiah 1:8 (#1) (id: 274359)

**"Will I not on that day ("** \- **"destroy wise men from Edom"**

## Obadiah 1:8 (#2) (id: 274360)

**"I"** \- **"destroy wise men from Edom"**

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** OBA 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Obadiah 1:8 (#3) (id: 274361)

**"and understanding from the mountain of Esau"**

This is the second part of the rhetorical question. You could also start a new sentence here. Yahweh continues the question form here to emphasize that he will certainly do this.

**"and understanding from the mountain of Esau"**

In this poetic style, the reader is expected to use the words **will I not on that day destroy** from the first rhetorical question in order to understand this second one. If that is not clear in your language, you could repeat those words here. Alternate translation: “and will I not on that day destroy understanding from the mountain of Esau?”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Obadiah 1:8 (#5) (id: 274363)

**""wise men from Edom,"**

In this poetic style, the same meaning is expressed twice but in different words in order to emphasize what is being said. Here, **wise men** and **understanding** both refer to people who are wise, and **Edom** and **the mountain of Esau** are both ways of referring to the country of Edom. If this is confusing in your language, you can say this only once, or emphasize the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “all people who are wise from the country of Edom”

Yahweh uses a repetitive series of sentences in verses 12–14 to show how badly the people of Edom have treated the people of Judah. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the charges against the people of Edom.

## Obadiah 1:16 (#1) (id: 274412)

**"For according to how you drank"**

As at the beginning of verse 15, here also the connecting word **For** indicates that this is a reason why the people of Edom should have helped the Israelites instead of joining in attacking them. Here also Yahweh describes how he will soon judge all nations for the way that they have treated others. There are two possibilities for how you can make this explicit, If it would be helpful in your language. Choosing between these possibilities depends on how you interpret the referent of the word **you**. The word **you** here is masculine plural, the first and only time it occurs in this form in the book. Throughout the book, the nation of Edom was addressed with the masculine singular form. This is also the last occurrence of the second person in the book. (1\) Because of these observations, the use of drinking here and throughout the Bible as a metaphor for suffering punishment, and the location of this suffering on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, it seems that here Obadiah stops addressing the people of Edom and returns to addressing the people of Israel. At the beginning of the book, Obadiah included the people of Israel when he said, “We have heard a report from Yahweh.” Now, near the end of the book, he addresses them again, giving them assurance that the people of Edom will be punished for what they did to the people of Israel. See the UST. (2\) This word **you** could refer to the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “You should have helped the people of Israel, because just as you drank”

## Obadiah 1:16 (#2) (id: 274413)

**"according to how you drank"**

Throughout the book of Obadiah, the nation of Edom is addressed with a masculine singular form of “you.” (The one feminine plural form in [1:13](https://ref.ly/Obad1:13) only addresses the women of Edom). Here, however, **you** is masculine plural. There are two possibilities for who is being addressed here. (1\) It refers to the people of Israel. This would explain the shift from singular to plural. Just as Obadiah addressed the people of Israel in the plural in [1:1](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1), so he addresses them in the plural now. This interpretation also fits with the metaphor used here and throughout the Bible that pictures suffering and divine punishment as drinking something that makes a person stagger, fall, and die. The people of Israel suffered and died in Jerusalem when the city was destroyed. This also allows the comparison in this verse to fit with the idea in the previous verse that Edom will suffer in the same way that they made Israel to suffer. See the UST. (2\) It refers to the people of Edom. In this case, the comparison is between how the people of Edom literally drank wine in celebration of Jerusalem’s destruction with how the nations will metaphorically drink God’s punishment. Either that, or the verb must be forced into a future meaning, and the comparison is between how God will punish the people of Edom in Jerusalem and how God will punish all the nations. Alternate translation: “just as I will punish you”

**"And saviors will go up to the mountain of Zion to judge the mountain of Esau"**

Even though **the mountain of Zion** is a figurative name for Jerusalem, it would be good to keep the imagery of this high place in Jerusalem where God’s temple was, if possible.

But with this figurative imagery, Yahweh is saying that he will bring it down and place his own people up high instead. you could also choose to express this meaning in plain language if that is how you have been translating the book and if **the mountain of Zion** would be misunderstood.

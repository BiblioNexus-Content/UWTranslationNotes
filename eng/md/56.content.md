## Titus - Introduction (id: 700145)

Introduction to Titus
=====================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of the book of Titus

1. Paul instructs Titus to appoint godly leaders. (1:1–16\)
2. Paul instructs Titus to train people to live godly lives. (2:1–3:11\)
3. Paul ends by sharing some of his plans and sending greetings to various believers. (3:12–15\)

### Who wrote the book of Titus?

Paul wrote the book of Titus. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a believer, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted believers. After he became a believer, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus.

### What is the book of Titus about?

Paul wrote this letter to Titus, his fellow worker, who was leading the churches on the island of Crete. Paul instructed him about selecting church leaders. Paul also described how believers should behave toward each other. He also encouraged them all to live in a way that pleases God.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Titus.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to Titus” or “A Letter to Titus.” (See: How to Translate Names)

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### In what roles can people serve within the church?

There are some teachings in the book of Titus about whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. Scholars disagree about the meaning of these teachings. Further study on these issues may be necessary before translating this book.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### Singular and plural **you**

In this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15\. (See Forms of ‘You’ — Singular)

### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?

This is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.

## Titus - Chapter 1 Introduction (id: 700146)

Titus 1 General Notes
=====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1–4\. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.

In verses 6–9, Paul lists several qualities that a man must have if he is to be an elder in the church. (See: Abstract Nouns) Paul gives a similar list in 1 Timothy 3\.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Elders

The church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include overseer, elder, pastor, and bishop.

Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Should, may, must

The ULT uses different words that indicate requirements or obligations. These verbs have different levels of force associated with them. The subtle differences may be difficult to translate. The UST translates these verbs in a more general way.

## Titus 1:4 (#1) (id: 140751)

**"a true son"**

Though Titus was not Paul’s biological **son**, they share a common faith in Christ. Paul considers relationship to Christ through faith to be more important than biological relationship. Thus, because of their relative ages and shared faith in Christ, Paul considers Titus as his own son. It may also be that Paul led Titus to faith in Christ, and so Titus is like a son in this spiritual sense. Alternate translation: “like a son to me”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

The connecting words **so that** introduce a goal or purpose relationship. The purpose for the elder to hold tightly to the trustworthy message is for him to be able to encourage others and rebuke those who oppose him.

* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: `33281@UWTranslationManual`)

**"For this reason, rebuke them severely"**

Alternate translation: “For that reason, you must use strong language that the Cretans will understand when you correct them”

* **Associated Passages:** TIT 1:13

## Titus 1:13 (#2) (id: 140789)

**"For this reason"**

The connecting words **For this reason** introduce a reason\-result relationship. The reason is that what the Cretan prophet said about his people is true (they are liars, evil, and lazy), and the result is that Titus should rebuke them severely for behaving that way. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “Therefore”

See: Connect — Reason\-and\-Result Relationship

* **Associated Passages:** TIT 1:13
* **Associated Articles:** Connect — Reason-and-Result Relationship (ID: `33331@UWTranslationManual`)

## Titus 1:13 (#3) (id: 140790)

**"them"**

Here the pronoun **them** could refer to: 

1\. the Cretan believers in general. This seems likely since the **testimony** is about all Cretans, and verse 14 says that they should not pay attention to “commands of people turning away from the truth.” In other words, they should not pay attention to the false teachers. Alternate translation: “the Cretan believers”

2\. the Cretan false teachers. In this case, verse 14 would be telling the false teachers not to pay attention to other false teachers. Alternate translation: “the false teachers”

## Titus 1:15 (#1) (id: 140796)

**"All things {are} pure to the ones {who are} pure"**

Here, Paul uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that being pure or pleasing to God is a matter of a person's inward thoughts, not a matter of outward actions or rituals. Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “If people are pure on the inside, everything that they do will be pure” or “When people have only good thoughts, nothing that they do will offend God”

Titus 2 General Notes
=====================

Paul continues giving Titus reasons to preach God’s word, and explains how the older men, older women, young men, and slaves or servants should live as believers.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Gender roles

Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are completely equal in all things. Other scholars believe God created men and women to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church. Translators should be careful not to let their understanding of this issue affect how they translate this passage.

### Slavery

Paul does not write in this chapter about whether slavery is good or bad; Paul teaches slaves to faithfully serve their masters. He teaches all believers to be godly and live rightly in every situation.

* **Associated Passages:** TIT 2:1

## Titus 2:1 (#1) (id: 140802)

**"But you"**

**"Older men, to be"**

A verb is lacking here that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply a verb here, drawing from the idea of “speak” in the previous verse, such as “teach” or “exhort.” Alternate translation: “Teach older men to be”

## Titus - Chapter 3 Introduction (id: 700148)

Titus 3 General Notes
=====================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

In this chapter, Paul continues giving Titus instructions on how to teach the elders and people under his care in Crete.

In verses 1–7 Paul explains how, by God's mercy, the Holy Spirit makes our lives new and motivates us to live in a new way.

In verses 8–11 Paul explains what Titus should avoid and how to treat those who cause contention among the believers.

In verses 12–15, Paul closes the letter by telling Titus what to do after he appoints elders in Crete and by delivering greetings from those with him.

Verse 15 formally concludes this letter. This is a common way of ending a letter in the ancient Near East.

Special Concepts in this Chapter
--------------------------------

### Genealogies

Genealogies (verse 9\) are lists that record a person’s ancestors or descendants and show from what tribe and family a person came. For example, priests came from the tribe of Levi and the family of Aaron. Some of these lists included stories of ancestors and even of spiritual beings. These lists and stories were used to argue about where things came from and about how important various people were.

Here, the phrase **Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet** and the quotation that follows could go with: (1\) verse 1: **The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from important texts.

## Mark 1:3 (#4) (id: 140954)

**""Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight""**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a connecting word in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Make ready the way of the Lord, yes, make his paths straight”

## Mark 1:41 (#2) (id: 141114)

**"having had compassion"**

Many ancient manuscripts read **having had compassion**. The ULT follows that reading. A few ancient manuscripts read “having become angry.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

**"But having strictly warned him, he immediately sent him away"** \- **"And he says to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them"**

Jesus **strictly warned** the man using the words recorded in [1:44](https://ref.ly/Mark1:44) before he **sent him away**. It might be helpful to make it clear that Jesus **strictly warned** the man before he **sent him away**. Alternate translation: “While he was immediately sending him away, he strictly warned him by saying to him, ‘See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.’” or “He immediately sent him away. Before he went, Jesus strictly warned him, saying to him, ‘See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.’”

## Mark 1:44 (#2) (id: 141120)

**"you say nothing to anyone"**

The words translated **nothing** and **anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “you certainly do not say anything to anyone”

**"show yourself to the priest"**

Jesus told the man to **show** himself **to the priest** so that the priest could look at his skin to see if his leprosy was really gone. The law of Moses required people to present themselves to the priest for inspection if they had been unclean but were now clean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “ask to be inspected by the priest” or “let yourself be examined by the priest”

**"offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded"**

Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to make a specific sacrifice. This made the person ceremonially clean, and they could participate once again in community religious activities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly.

**"Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say, ‘Get up and take up your mat and walk"**

Jesus is using the question form to show the scribes which of these things is **easier** to say. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. He could mean: (1\) that saying **Your sins are forgiven** is easier than saying **Get up and take up your mat and walk**. This is because it is easy to show that someone is lying when they try to heal a paralytic, but it is not easy to show that someone is lying when they claim to forgive sins. Alternate translation: “It is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ than to say, ‘Get up and take up your mat and walk.’” (2\) that both things are equally easy to say. Alternate translation: “Saying ‘Your sins are forgiven’ is just as easy as saying, ‘Get up and take up your mat and walk.’”

**"The ones being healthy do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness"**

Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored.

Alternate translation: “You have not understood what you have read about what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and the ones with him—how he went into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the loaves of the presence, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and he also gave to the ones being with him.”

Here Jesus refers to a story about **David** before he became king. The current king, Saul was trying to kill David. So, David ran away to the priest who was serving God at the time, **Abiathar**. David and the men who ran away with him were very hungry, so they asked the Abiathar for food. Abiathar gave them the special bread that was laid out in God’s presence every day, and David and his men ate this bread. You can read this story in [1 Samuel 21:1–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:6). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry after he and the ones with him escaped from King Saul, who wanted to kill him? He visited the high priest Abiathar, went into the house of God, and ate the loaves of the presence, which was not lawful to eat except for the priests. He also gave some of it to the ones being with him.”

## Mark 4:12 (#4) (id: 141446)

**"Looking, they may look"** \- **"hearing, they may hear"**

Here the author of the quotation repeats the words **look** and **hear** in order to emphasize that the people really do **look** and **hear**. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. Otherwise, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “They will certainly look … they will certainly hear” or “They will indeed look … they will indeed hear”

**"it is not hidden except so that it might be revealed, nor has it become secret except so that it might come into visibility"**

These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than and in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one. Alternate translation: “it is not hidden except so that it might be revealed; yes, it has not become secret except so that it might come into visibility” or “it is not hidden except so that it will come into visibility”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:7](https://ref.ly/Mark5:7) and [5:8](https://ref.ly/Mark5:8) into a verse bridge, as the UST does, in order to include the reason why the man cried out as he did before stating that the man cried out. Alternate translation: “And Jesus was saying to him, ‘Come out from the man, unclean spirit.’ So, crying out with a loud voice, he says, ‘What to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I make you swear by God, do not torment me.’”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [6:17](https://ref.ly/Mark6:17) and [6:18](https://ref.ly/Mark6:18) into a verse bridge, as the UST does, in order to include the reasons why Herod **seized John and bound him in prison** before stating that he did those things. Alternate translation: “For Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. Then, John was saying to Herod, ‘It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother.’ So, because of Herodias, Herod himself, having sent, seized John and bound him in prison.”

**"having seen some of his disciples, that they eat"**

Here, the phrase **that they eat** refers directly back to the phrase **some of his disciples**. Mark expresses the idea in this way to introduce whom the Pharisees and scribes saw and then explain what they saw them doing. If referring to who were seen and then referring back to them with the phrase **that they eat** would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information. Alternate translation: “having seen some of his disciples eating”

**"you no longer permit him to do anything"**

The words translated **no longer** and **anything** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “you permit him to do nothing any longer” or “you certainly do not permit him to do anything any longer”

Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **your** and **you** throughout this verse as well as the command **throw it out** are singular.

**"will be salted with fire"**

Here Jesus speaks as if people were food or sacrifices that **will be salted with fire**. In Jesus’ culture, people would put salt on their food and on sacrifices that they offered to God. The salt preserved the food and made it taste better. When someone is salted **with fire**, it most likely refers to that person experiencing difficult or painful situations that eventually help and sanctify that person. However, Jesus does not explain the metaphor, and Christians disagree on what it means. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. If necessary, you could state more explicitly that Jesus is referring to some form of suffering and its effects on people.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are calling me good without thinking carefully.” or “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good!”

## Mark 10:19 (#1) (id: 142682)

**"You know the commandments—do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not testify falsely, do not defraud, honor your father and mother"**

Here Jesus quotes commands from the law that God gave to Moses. The first four commands and the sixth command come from either [Exodus 20:12–16](https://ref.ly/Exod20:12-Exod20:16) or [Deuteronomy 5:16–20](https://ref.ly/Deut5:16-Deut5:20). The fifth command is not directly quoted from the law that God gave Moses, but it may be a summary of the command found in [Exodus 20:17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:17) or [Deuteronomy 5:21](https://ref.ly/Deut5:21). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “You know the commandments—as you can read in the Scriptures, ‘Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not testify falsely, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother’”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea here in such a way that it does not sound as if it is totally impossible for **a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God**. Alternate translation: “Consider how difficult it is for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle. That illustrates how difficult it is for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the sentences with a word other than and in order to show that the second sentence is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two sentences Alternate translation: “whoever desires to become great among you will be your servant; indeed, whoever desires to be first among you will be your slave” or “whoever desires to become first or great among will you be your servant or slave”

## Mark 11:3 (#7) (id: 142853)

**"back"**

Many ancient manuscripts read **back**. The ULT follows that reading. In this case, it is more likely that the phrase **and immediately he sends it** is part of what Jesus wanted the disciples to say (see previous note on this whole sentence). Other ancient manuscripts do not include the word **back**. In this case, it is more likely that the phrase **and immediately he sends it** is what Jesus predicts that the people who asked the question will do (see previous note on this whole sentence). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

The question **By what authority do you do these things** and the question **who gave you this authority, so that you might do these things** could: (1\) be two separate questions, the first asking about the nature of the authority and the second about who gave it to Jesus. Alternate translation: “By what kind of authority do you do these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority, so that you might do these things” (2\) both have the same meaning and be asked together to strongly question Jesus’ authority. If you choose this option, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these two questions into one question. Alternate translation: “Who was it who gave you the authority to do these things?”

**"a denarius"**

A **denarius** was a silver coin equivalent to about one day’s wage for a hired worker. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “a silver coin” or “a coin worth one day’s wage”

Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **far**.

**"no one any longer was daring"**

The words translated **no one** and **any longer** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here.

**"How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David"**

This is not a rhetorical question. Rather, Jesus’ listeners had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement.

It is a difficult question, like the ones the Jewish leaders asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later.

**"two lepta"**

The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value”

## Mark 12:43 (#2) (id: 143258)

**"this poor widow put in more than all"**

Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put **more** money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not express them as if they were figurative.

**"let the one on the housetop not go down nor go in to take anything from his house"**

Where Jesus lived, the tops of houses were flat. People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses. Jesus assumes that his hearers know this and that they know that the roofs were accessed by an exterior staircase at the back of the house, distant from the entry at the front. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit.

The bread could somehow become Jesus’ **body**, or Jesus’ **body** could be present in some way when people eat the bread, or the bread could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **body**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible. Alternate translation: “This functions as my body”

Many ancient manuscripts read **of the covenant**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “of the new covenant.” The word “new” may have been accidentally added here because it appears in the parallel story in Luke (see [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20)). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

A **hymn** is a song or poem that is sung to praise God. The Jews would traditionally sing a psalm from Psalms 113–118 at the end of the Passover meal, so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was likely one of these psalms.

He also assumes that his readers will know that the law includes a command to bury on the same day anyone who was executed as Jesus was (see [Deuteronomy 21:22–23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:22-Deut21:23)). So, if he wanted bury Jesus’ body, Joseph needed to receive the body and bury it quickly, before the next day began. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include this information in a footnote or make some of it more explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: “evening already having come, because it was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath when no one could bury anyone”

**"the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath"**

Here, as Mark indicates **the Day of Preparation** is **the day before the Sabbath**. On this day, Jews would prepare for the Sabbath so that they would not have to do work on that day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the day on which Jews prepared for the Sabbath, that is, the day before the Sabbath” or “the day before the Sabbath, the day on which Jews prepared for the Sabbath”

Here the young man refers to **the place** within the tomb where Joseph of Arimathea and his helpers **put** Jesus’ body. This **place** was probably a shelf or ledge. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “this is the flat area where they put his body” or “this is the ledge within this tomb where they put him”

## Mark 16:7 (#1) (id: 144026)

**"But"**

Here, the word **But** introduces a command that contrasts with what the young man said in the previous verse about seeing where Jesus’ body lay. Now, in contrast, the angel commands the women to leave the tomb. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,” or “But do not stay here. Instead,”

## Mark 16:7 (#2) (id: 144027)

**"to his disciples and to Peter"**

The phrase **and to Peter** is not making a distinction between **Peter** and the disciples by indicating that **Peter** is not part of the group of Jesus’ **disciples**. Rather, the phrase **and Peter** is being used to emphasize that of all of the disciples of Jesus, these women should take special care to tell **Peter** the information that follows this phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to Peter and to the rest of his disciples” or “to his disciples, and particularly to Peter”

**"to Peter, ‘He is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he said to you"**

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “to Peter that Jesus is going before them to Galilee and that they will see him there, just as he said to them”

## Mark 16:8 (#1) (id: 144030)

**"having gone out, they fled from the tomb, for trembling and amazement was gripping them"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because trembling and amazement was gripping them, having gone out, they ran from the tomb”

**"trembling and amazement was gripping them"**

Here, when **trembling and amazement** are **gripping** people, it means that these people are overcome by **trembling and amazement**. In other words, they cannot help but experience these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they were overcome by trembling and amazement” or “they could not help but experience trembling and amazement”

**"they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid"**

## Mark 16:8 (#7) (id: 144036)

**"they said nothing to anyone"**

The words translated **nothing** and **to anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “they told no one anything”

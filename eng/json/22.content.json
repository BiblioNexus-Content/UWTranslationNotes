The outline above attempts to offer a reasonable and general way of outlining this book but there are other possible ways this book could be outlined.</p><h3>What is the Song of Songs about?</h3><p>The Song of Songs is a poem or a series of poems that celebrate love and intimacy between a man and a woman. Jews traditionally have interpreted the book as a picture of God’s love for his people Israel. Until the 1800’s the main view among Christians was that this book is primarily a picture of love between Christ and his bride, Christians. Since the 1800’s the more common view of the meaning of this book among Christians is that it is a poem or a series of poems that give a beautiful picture of love between a man and a woman. Many Christians also think that even though the main meaning of this poem is to give a beautiful portrayal of romantic love between a man and a woman, that there are lessons in this book to be learned about God’s love for his bride, Christians.</p><h3>Who wrote the Song of Songs?</h3><p>The first verse of the book (“The song of songs, which is of Solomon”) gives the idea that King Solomon of Israel wrote it. However, there are different possible ways to interpret the meaning of this title. A translation note for this verse discusses the different possible meanings.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>This book is traditionally titled “Song of Songs,” which means the very best song, or “Song of Solomon.” It may also be called “Songs of Love,” “Great Poems of Love,” or “The Love Songs of Solomon.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26805\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">How to Translate Names</span>)</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>What place do the descriptions of sexual behavior have in the Song of Songs?</h3><p>The Song of Songs approves of sexual behavior expressing love between a husband his wife.</p><h2>Part 3: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>How many characters are in the Song of Songs?</h3><p>The two main characters in this book are the man and the woman, who love each other. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song8:8-Song8:9\">8:8–9</a> the woman’s brothers speak among themselves and in different places throughout the book a group of women called the “daughters of Jerusalem,” speak or are spoken to. However, it is possible that the group of women is not real and that the woman only imagined them and that they are put into the poem for poetic effect.</p><p>Some interpreters believe there may be more characters than these, but this is not certain. The ULT and UST versions recognize only the man, the woman, the group of women (and possibly a group of friends in some parts), and the woman’s brothers.</p><h3>What are the lines in the UST about people speaking?</h3><p>The Song of Songs is a poem that shows the thoughts and words of a man, a woman, the woman’s friends, and the woman’s brothers. Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. So to help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking.</p><p>Before each speech, the UST has a header which identifies the speaker and often the audience in ways like this: “The woman speaking to the women of Jerusalem,” “The woman speaking to the man,” “The man speaking to the woman,” or “The woman speaking to herself.” Translators are encouraged to include these ways of identifying the speaker and the audience, and to format them differently from the scripture text. The translators should also include an initial note explaining that these explanations are not actually part of the text of scripture.</p><p>There are different views among Bible scholars about who the man is who is in love with the woman, whether it is a shepherd boy or king Solomon or whether both speak in this book at various times and are competing for the woman’s love. The headers in the UST will indicate when them man is speaking or being spoken to with headers such as “The man speaking to the woman he loves” and “The woman speaking to the man she loves,” but will not indicate the identity of the man.</p><h3>How should one translate the Song of Songs if the readers will view certain terms as coarse, vulgar, or improper?</h3><p>Readers might consider many images or forms appearing in the Song of Songs as improper when translated. The translator should try to avoid offensive language if possible, by using expressions that will not cause offense. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26682\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Euphemism</span>)</p><h3>How do I translate metaphors and similes in this book?</h3><p>There are many metaphors and similes in this book. These figures of speech are used to add poetic beauty and emotional effect, however their meaning is sometimes unclear and sometimes it is unclear whether or not there is a sexual meaning intended or a double meaning (both a literal and a sexual meaning). However, though meanings are often unclear, it is not always necessary to clarify the meaning and often ambiguity in translation is best. You can translate the words as they are written in order to avoid committing to a specific meaning. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h3>Translating terms of endearment</h3><p>The word the ULT translates as “my beloved” occurs 26 times in this book and each time it occurs the woman uses it to refer to the man she loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout this book. The word the ULT translates as “my darling” appears nine times in this book. Each time it occurs the man uses it to refer the woman he loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout the book.</p>",

In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h2>Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter</h2><h3>The lines indicating who is speaking and who is being spoken to.</h3><p>Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience.

It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking. Before each speech, the UST has a header which identifies the speaker and the audience. You may wish to do the same in your translation.</p><h3>“I am black”</h3><p>In the ancient Near East, rich people usually had lighter skin because they did not need to work outside in the sun. This young woman had to work outside in the sun, and her skin became dark as a result and this is why she says “I am black” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:5-Song1:6\">1:5–6</a>.</p>",

Because the woman describes her body in a poetic way with images, it is recommended that you either maintain these images or select images from your context and language that communicate the same concepts.

The man responds in 2:2 by using a simile to tell her how special he thinks she is when compared to other women. She then uses a simile in 2:3 to tell him how special she thinks he is compared to other men. When translating these verses one will need to pay close attention to the translation notes and the UST in order to understand the meaning.</p><h2>Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter</h2><h3>Chiasm</h3><p>Hebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary a device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:14\">Song of Songs 2:14</a> the author uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates this verse as “show me <strong>your appearance</strong>, make me hear <strong>your voice</strong>, for <strong>your voice</strong> {is} sweet, and <strong>your appearance</strong> {is} lovely” (the repeated phrases are highlighted for the purpose of illustration). Notice that the phrases “your appearance” and “your voice” are repeated in this verse and they are repeated in an AB-BA sequence: “your appearance...your voice...your voice...your appearance.”</p>",

You could also use a general section header such as “The woman searches for the man she loves at night and finds him” which does not comment on whether this was a dream, a real event or something imagined.</p>",

The woman is not actually dwelling in these places but rather the man is using imaginative and poetic language to describe how he feels about being separated from her and to describe his desire to be with her. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:12\">4:12</a> the man uses poetic language to describe the fact that the woman he loves is temporarily inaccessible.</p><h2>Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter</h2><h3>The Garden Metaphor</h3><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1\">4:12–5:1</a> is an extended metaphor. This metaphor is a conversation between the man and the woman he loves in which the man first compares the woman he loves to “a locked garden” (in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song4:15\">4:12–4:15</a>) where many delightful things grow and then the woman responds by inviting the man to come to her garden in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:16\">4:16</a>. The man then responds to her invitation in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song5:1\">5:1</a>. The term <strong>garden</strong> is used as a metaphor for the woman in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:12\">4:12</a>, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:16\">4:16</a> (two times), and in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song5:1\">5:1</a>. You should be consistent in how you translate the term “garden.” In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:13\">4:13</a> the man speaks of the woman’s body as “an orchard of pomegranate trees with delicious fruits” and then in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:16\">4:16</a> the woman invites the man to <strong>come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit</strong>. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26686\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Biblical Imagery — Extended Metaphors</span>)</p><h3>The “sister” metaphor</h3><p>The phrase <strong>my sister</strong> is used in 4:9; 4:10, 4:12, 5:1, and 5:2. The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase the same way each of the five times it occurs in this book because the author uses it with the same meaning every time. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in 4:9 for more information regarding this phrase.</p>",

(See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26706\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Metaphor</span>)</p><h2>Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter</h2><h3>Order of events</h3><p>5:2–8 seems to describe events that would have chronologically and logically occurred before the events described in 3:6–5:1. The solution to this seeming problem is to understand that this book is poetry and that the author is poetically describing emotions and feelings that occur between a man and woman who romantically love each other. Because the author is using poetry to describe the couple’s romantic relationship and its associated feelings, he does not need to follow the conventions of chronological story telling.</p><h3>Whether 5:2–8 describes events that really happened or that happened in a dream.</h3><p>There are two main views among Bible scholars regarding the events described in 5:2–8. One view is that the events which 5:2–8 describe happened in a dream. The other view is that the events that 5:2–8 describe happened after the man awakened the women from sleeping or from being nearly asleep. The vast majority of Bible scholars think that the first view is correct, that the events described in 5:2–8 happened in a dream.</p><h3>The “sister” metaphor</h3><p>The phrase <strong>my sister</strong> is used in 4:9; 4:10, 4:12, 5:1, and 5:2. The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase in 5:1, and 5:2 the same way as you translated it in 4:9; 4:10, and 4:12 because the author uses it with the same meaning in this chapter. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in 4:9 for more information regarding this phrase.</p><h3>An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “towers of” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song5:13\">5:13</a></h3><p>In verse 13, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “towers of.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “yielding.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “yielding” is used in place of “towers of” then, the first portion of 5:13 in the ULT would read “His cheeks {are} like a bed of spices, yielding herbal spices” (and The UST would read “His cheeks are like a garden where spices grow that produce sweet-smelling perfume”). The phrase “yielding herbal spices” would then be further describing the phrase “a bed of spices.” The point of the comparison would be that the man’s cheeks smell like a garden bed of spices which yields herbal spices. If you choose to use the word “yielding” in your translation you could explain the basis of the comparison for your readers in your translation if you think it would help them. Alternate translation: “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that produce herbal spices” or “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that yield herbal spices”</p>",

If “one who is loved” is used instead of “love” then, the portion of 7:6 that the ULT translates as “love with delights!” would instead be translated “one who is loved, with all your delights!”</p><h3>An alternate translation possibility for the words that the ULT translates as “the lips of those who sleep” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song7:9\">7:9</a></h3><p>In verse 9, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “the lips of those who sleep.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “lips and teeth.” The translators of the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) thought this and translated this phrase as “my lips and my teeth.” If a Bible translation exists in your region that translates this phrase with the word “teeth” instead of “those who sleep” consider using “lips and teeth” instead of “the lips of those who sleep” in your translation.</p>",

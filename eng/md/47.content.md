The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that God uses them to make God known in many places, or in every place that they visit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea clearer. Alternate translation: “in every place we go” or “throughout the world”

**"we are a fragrance of Christ to God"**

Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (See: [2:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:14)). He identifies himself and his fellow workers as a **fragrance** that comes from **Christ** and which goes toward **God**. By speaking in this way, he shows that **we** are those who represent or declare who Christ is in the presence of God. Just like everyone smells a good smell and knows where it comes from, so everyone notices Paul and his fellow workers and realizes that they represent **Christ** before **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Make sure that your translation fits with the previous and the following verses. Alternate translation: “we are like a good odor that spreads from Christ before God” or “we represent Christ before God”

The author uses this form to contrast “the ones perishing” and “the ones being saved” (See: [2:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally contrasts two groups of people.

If reversing the order from [2:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15) would be confusing for your readers, and if it would not be good style, you could reverse the order here to match that in [2:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15).

**"an aroma"** \- **"an aroma"**

Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (See: [2:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:14-2Cor2:15)). He specifically explains what kind of **aroma** he and his fellow workers are. Those who do not believe think that the **aroma** smells bad, while those who do believe think that the **aroma** smells good. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly.

Twice here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word. He could be using this form because: (1\) **from** indicates the source of the **aroma**, and **to** indicates the effects of the **aroma**. Alternate translation: “that smells like death and leads to death … that smells like life and leads to life” or “of death causing death … of life causing life” (2\) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the **aroma** is characterized completely by either **death** or **life**.

This **letter** is not a physical document, but is **written** in their **hearts**, and **all men** can **read** it. Paul speaks in this way to indicate that the recommendation he relies on is the Corinthian believers. In other words, the fact that they believe and that they are close with Paul (**in our hearts**) shows that Paul is trustworthy and a true apostle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way.

**"you are a letter of Christ having been administered by us, not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh"**

Here Paul continues to speak as if the Corinthians were a **letter**. Here, he states that this **letter** was written by **Christ** and **administered** by Paul and his fellow workers. He means that **Christ** is the one who enabled the Corinthians to believe, and **Christ** worked through Paul and his fellow workers to do that. Paul then contrasts a **letter** written with **ink** and on **tablets of stone** with a **letter** written by the power of the **Spirit** and on **hearts of flesh**. What he means by this is that the letter is the Corinthians, not some written document, and that the message is communicated by the **Spirit**, not by letters written with **ink**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “you are like a letter of Christ having been administered by us, not written with ink but as if with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but as if on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “you are a message from Christ having been administered by us, not communicated by ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not presented on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh”

In other words, some of God’s **glory** became part of Moses’ **face**, and the Israelites could not **look intently** at his face because it was a little like looking at God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](https://ref.ly/Exod34:29-Exod34:35).

Here Paul speaks as if a **veil** kept people from understanding the **old covenant** when it is “read,” and this veil is not **lifted**. He speaks in this way to identify the inability of people to understand the **old covenant** with how Moses’ kept the Israelites from looking at his face with a **veil**. Just as the **veil** kept them from seeing the glory on his face, so a **veil** keeps people from understanding **the reading of the old covenant**. Since Paul uses this figure of speech to connect what he is saying with what he has said about Moses, you should preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is a like a veil that remains at the reading of the old covenant, not being lifted”

**"our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to the ones perishing"**

Here Paul again uses the language of “veiling,” just as he did in [3:12–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:12-2Cor3:18). A **gospel** that **is veiled** is one that people do not understand or believe in. If possible, express the idea the same way you did in [3:12–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:12-2Cor3:18).

If **minds** can see **light**, they can understand something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile or express the idea plainly.

**"our earthly house of this tent is torn down, we have a building from God, an eternal house in the heavens, not made with hands"**

Here Paul speaks as if a person’s body were a **house**, **tent**, or **building** in which that the person lives. This was a common way to refer to a person’s body in Paul’s culture. He identifies the current body as a **tent** that is **torn down**, because this body will die. He describes the body that a person will have when God resurrects them as a **building from God** and an **eternal house** that is **not made with hands**. This is an important metaphor in [5:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:9), so preserve the **house**, **tent**, and **building** language if possible. If it would be helpful, you could use a simile or identify the **house** in another natural way. Alternate translation: “our earthly house of this tent, that is, our mortal body, is torn down, we have a building from God, that is, our resurrection body, an eternal house in the heavens, not made with hands”

Paul also begins to refer to receiving new, resurrection bodies as if they were pieces of clothing that people could put on. This also is an important figure of speech for the following verses, so preserve the language if possible. If it is necessary, you could use a simile or express the idea in another natural way that fits with the “building” language.

## 2 Corinthians 5:14 (#10) (id: 243572)

**"all died"**

Here Paul speaks as if **all died** because or when Jesus **died**. Since the following verse states that some people are still “living,” he cannot mean that every person has physically **died**. He may mean that people have **died** to sin, or that they participated in how Christ **died**, or that who they used to be **died**. Since some or all of these interpretations are possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in a form that could allow for several of these interpretations, such as in simile form. Alternate translation: “in a way, all died” or “all died in a manner of speaking”

**"having been raised"**

**"according to the flesh."** \- **"according to the flesh"**

Here Paul uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to refer to human ways of thinking.

**"Even if"**

Paul is speaking as **if** it were a possibility that **we regarded Christ according to the flesh** in the past, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word or phrase such as “although” or “despite the fact that.” Alternate translation: “Even though” or “Despite the fact that”

**"Therefore"**

Here, the word **Therefore** could introduce an inference from: (1\) [5:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:16).

## 2 Corinthians 6:2 (#3) (id: 243636)

**""At an acceptable time I listened to you,"**

The two clauses in the quotation mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Make sure that you use the same form for Paul’s interpretation of the quotation, which is also in parallel form. Alternate translation: “At an acceptable time I listened to you; yes, in a day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is a favorable time; yes, now is a day of salvation”

Alternate translation: “I will be to you as a Father; yes, you will be to me as sons and daughters”

**"We wronged no one; we ruined no one; we took advantage of no one"**

Here Paul uses three phrases with similar structure and meaning to strongly deny that he did anything to hurt any of the Corinthians. It is possible that the word **wronged** refers to doing something unjust, the word **ruined** refers to corrupting or perverting someone, and the phrase **took advantage of** refers to gaining money or things from somebody without doing anything in return. If the repetition would not communicate a strong denial in your language, or if you do not have three words for these ideas, you could express the idea with only one or two strong clauses.

## 2 Corinthians 9:6 (#3) (id: 243982)

**"the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings"**

Here Paul speaks as if the Corinthians, by giving money to the collection, were sowing seeds and reaping the harvest from what those seeds produced. In the second clause, he uses the word **blessings** to show the Corinthians how to apply what he says about farmers to the collection. Just as farmers receive a harvest that fits with how they sowed, so people who give to help other believers will receive **blessings** that fit with what and how much they gave. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or clearly express how the metaphor relates to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “giving money to help other believers is like farming. The one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings” or “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing generously will also reap generously. Similarly, the one giving blessings to fellow believers will also receive blessings”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly; yes, the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings”

Here, just as in [10:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:3), Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers were involved in **warfare**. In this verse, he specifically speaks about their **weapons** and about their enemies’ **strongholds**. He defines the **strongholds** as **strategies** or arguments against him and the gospel. Paul means by this that God empowers him and his fellow workers to prove that these arguments are false. Paul does not mean that they are physically fighting against people or destroying physical strongholds. Preserve the metaphor if it is clear in your language or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “what we use to defend ourselves are like weapons of warfare that are not fleshly but are powerful to God for overcoming strategies and arguments, which are like strongholds” or “we do not fight with fleshly weapons but with arguments that are powerful to God for the defeating of powerful enemies and strategies”

In this verse, he speaks about **every high thing**, which are fortifications or walls. He means that he and his fellow workers defeat or discredit anything that claims to be as great or important as **the knowledge of God**. Paul also speaks about taking thoughts **captive**. Just as the victor in a war takes the conquered people **captive**, so Paul and his fellow workers wish to take peoples’ thoughts **captive** so that these people are obedient to Christ.

**"I am not lying"**

Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **lying**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “I am definitely speaking the truth”

Here, the clauses **whether in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows** interrupt the sentence to indicate that Paul does not know exactly what form the ascent into heaven took. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move these clauses to wherever they would naturally appear in your language.

**"I know a man in Christ—"** \- **"such a {man} having been caught up to the third heaven 14 years ago"**

In [12:2–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:2-2Cor12:5), Paul uses the third person to speak about a person who traveled to the **third heaven**. It is clear from [12:6–7](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:6-2Cor12:7) that he is actually speaking about himself. So, Paul uses the third person to avoid boasting directly about himself. If possible, use the third person in [12:2–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:2-2Cor12:5) and reveal later that Paul himself is this **man**. If necessary, you could reveal in this verse that Paul is speaking about himself. Make sure your translation here fits with how you translate [12:3–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:3-2Cor12:5). Alternate translation: “I know a man in Christ … such a man having been caught up to the third heaven 14 years ago. That man is me.” or “I know a man in Christ, that is, me … I was caught up to the third heaven 14 years ago”

**"whether in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know"**

Here Paul refers to a common question related to stories about people traveling to heaven: in what way does the person ascend into heaven? There were three primary ways a person could ascend: they could go into heaven physically in their body, they could go into heaven in a dream, or they could go into heaven with only their non\-physical part, that is, their spirit. Here Paul indicates that he does not know in what way the **man in Christ** ascended into heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “whether in bodily form, I do not know, or not in bodily form, I do not know” or “whether physically, I do not know, or spiritually, I do not know”

**"up to the third heaven"**

Many people in Paul’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. Here, Paul refers to the **third heaven**. Since he does not specify how many heavens he thinks there are, it is best not to clarify whether this is the highest heaven or not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers more clearly to the **third** out of multiple heavens. Alternate translation: “up to the third out of multiple heavens” or “into the third sphere of heaven”

## 2 Corinthians 12:7 (#7) (id: 244327)

**"so that I would not become arrogant"**

Here most ancient manuscripts include the clause **so that I would not become super arrogant**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts do not have this clause. Most likely, this clause was accidentally omitted because Paul had already said it once. So, it is recommended that you use the reading of the ULT.

## 2 Corinthians 12:14 (#8) (id: 244376)

**"For the children should not store up for the parents, but the parents for the children"**

Here Paul speaks of himself as a parent and the Corinthians as his **children**. In Paul’s culture, **parents** generally saved money for their **children** to use. Paul uses this custom to illustrate how he, as a parent, should be giving to the Corinthians instead of the Corinthians, as children, giving to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is speaking of himself as a parent and the Corinthians as children. Alternate translation: “For children, like you, should not store up for your parents, like me. Rather, the parents, like me, should store up for the children, like you.” or “For I am like your parent, and you are like my children. Children should not store up for the parent, but the parent for the children”

**"I will most gladly spend and be completely spent"**

Here, the phrase **But let it be {so}** indicates that something is agreed upon or certainly true. Paul could be referring to: (1\) what he is about to say about not being a **burden** to the Corinthians. He means that he and the Corinthians can agree about that. Alternate translation: “But here is what we can agree on: I myself did not burden you. However” (2\) what he said in the previous verse about loving the Corinthians, although he may be loved less. He means that even if that is true, he will still not **burden** the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “Besides all that, I myself did not burden you. However,” or “Even if that has happened, I myself did not burden you. However,”

**"Every matter must be established on the basis of the mouth of two or three witnesses"**

Paul is quoting here from Deuteronomy 19:15\. He has been accusing the Corinthian believers of doing wrong, and so he compares the number of his visits, during which he has observed and will observe this wrong behavior, with the number of witnesses that the Old Testament required for convicting someone of doing wrong. You may want to include some of this information in a footnote.

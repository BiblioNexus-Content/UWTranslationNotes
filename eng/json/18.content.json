Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh has allowed him to experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.</p><h3>What title should translators give to this book?</h3><p>The book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or simply “Job.” Or they may choose a different title such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”</p><h3>Who wrote the book of Job?</h3><p>We do not know who wrote the book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>Does sin cause suffering?</h3><p>When a person sins against Yahweh, that can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors had sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26240\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Sin</span>)</p><h3>Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?</h3><p>Job 2:11 describes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. However, they did not succeed in comforting Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” What they said did not help Job, because they did not understand the full truth about God. However, they did care about Job, and they did want to help him. In those ways, they did what friends would do, and in that sense the word “friends” is appropriate.</p><h3>When did the events in the book of Job take place?</h3><p>We do not know when the events in the book of Job took place. The story is set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to verses in the books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which were written many centuries after Abraham and Isaac lived. It is possible that the book of Job was written at a later time to describe the events of an earlier time.</p><h3>The “sea monster”</h3><p>Ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean. They referred to it as the “sea monster.” People in Job&apos;s culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos, and they associated this sea monster with that chaos. There are references to this creature in the book of Job under the names Leviathan in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:8\">3:8</a>, the “sea monster” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job7:12\">7:12</a>, Rahab in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:13\">9:13</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job26:12\">26:12</a>, and the “fleeing serpent” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job26:13\">26:13</a>. The description of Leviathan in chapter 41 also seems to be a description of this same creature. Notes at these various places suggest how you might represent these references in your translation.</p><h2>Part 3: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>Is the book of Job difficult to translate?</h3><p>The book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases. That makes parts of it hard to understand and translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may also decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.</p><h3>What style of writing is in the book of Job?</h3><p>The author begins and ends the book of Job by relating what happened to Job in narrative form. In the rest of the book, the characters speak in poetry. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom. The relationship of human conduct to human prosperity and suffering is an important theme in wisdom literature.</p><h3>Hebrew poetry: parallelism</h3><p>Hebrew poetry was based on repetition of meaning rather than on repetition of sound like poetry in some other languages. A speaker would typically say one phrase and then say another phrase (or two) that meant a similar thing, an opposite thing, or something supplementary. The subsequent phrase or phrases would advance the meaning of the first phrase in one of these ways. In many cases it would be good to show this to your readers by including all the phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that would show how the later phrase or phrases are advancing the meaning of the first one. Throughout the book, notes will model ways of doing this in various cases, although not in most cases. It is hoped that these illustrations will give translators an idea of what they could do in any given instance.</p><h3>Hebrew poetry: chiasm</h3><p>Hebrew poetry often uses a form known as “chiasm.” It will make a statement consisting of two elements. It will then make a parallel, contrasting, or supplemental statement consisting of those same two elements, but in reverse order. For example, Job says in 3:5:</p><p>May it not rejoice among the days of the year; into the number of the months may it not come.</p><p>You may wish to show this form in your translation by following the Hebrew word order, even if that would not ordinarily be the order you would follow in your language. For 3:5, English might ordinarily say:</p><p>May it not rejoice among the days of the year; may it not come into the number of the months.</p><p>But the ULT follows the Hebrew word order in order to give an idea of this characteristic form of Hebrew poetry.</p><h3>“answered and said”</h3><p>The author uses the phrase “answered and said” many times in the book of Job. This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and”. The word “answered” tells for what purpose a person “said” something. Specifically, they said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and,” such as “responded.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26694\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Hendiadys</span>)</p><h3>“fear”</h3><p>In several places in the book, the author uses a word from the root “fear,” such as the verb “fear” or the adjective “fearful,” in a specific sense. He uses the word to describe an awe of God that leads to holy living. He is not referring to an emotion and saying that the person is afraid of God. He means that the person respects and obeys God. Notes will call attention to this usage where it occurs, and they will suggest translations such as the verb “respect” and the adjective “respectful.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26697\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Idiom</span>)</p><h3>“behold”</h3><p>In many places in the book, characters use the term “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation in these instances.</p><h3>“nose”</h3><p>In several places in the book, various characters use the term “nose” to mean anger. They do this by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.”</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Job 1 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Wealth</h3><p>In the time and place in which the book of Job is set, a person’s wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. The book describes how Job owned thousands of animals in order to indicate that he was very rich. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26687\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information</span>)</p><h3>Sacrifices</h3><p>Job was a man who obeyed Yahweh carefully. We might therefore wonder why he offered sacrifices on behalf of his children, as 1:5 describes, since he was not one of the descendants of Aaron, who were the only ones whom the law of Moses allowed to offer sacrifices. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the time when God gave Moses the law, so his religious practices were different from those of the Hebrew people after Moses. In Job’s culture, it was normal and acceptable for the father to act as a priest for his family and to offer sacrifices on their behalf. The events that this book relates took place about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than with the rest of the Old Testament. (See:<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25789\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Godly</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25959\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Law of Moses</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“the adversary”</h3><p>The Hebrew word satan means “adversary.” The Old Testament uses the word in that sense in several places, for example, 1 Kings 11:14, “Yahweh raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.” In chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job, there is a character called “the satan” or “the adversary.” This seems to be a created angelic being who opposes righteous people and accuses them before God of having wrong motives. Many interpreters of the book of Job identify this character with Satan, the devil. The UST follows that interpretation, but the ULT translates the term more basically as “adversary.” You can decide how to translate this term in your own translation.</p>",

He communicates this by cursing the day he was born, which is a way of saying by association that he wishes he had never lived. This is a powerful poetic device that would be good to show to your readers, so it would be preferable to translate the device itself, rather than express only its meaning or implications in your translation. In other words, for example, it would be appropriate to translate Job’s actual words in 3:3, “May the day on which I was born perish,” rather than have him say something like, “I do not feel that my life is worth living any more, and so I wish I had never been born.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26689\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">When to Keep Information Implicit</span>)</p>",

He says that God corrects good people if they begin to do bad things, and he encourages Job to consider why God is correcting him. Ordinarily this would be very good advice. But Eliphaz does not understand the special circumstances that Job is in. Job himself does not understand them. God cannot explain to Job that he has allowed the adversary to test him to see whether he will still trust God even if he loses his family, possessions, and health, because if God explained this, that would make the test invalid. So this section of the book, in which Job’s three friends speak with him, presents a paradox: What would ordinarily be good advice is not good advice under these special circumstances.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Rhetorical questions</h3><p>Eliphaz often uses the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate his questions as statements or exclamations. Notes will offer suggestions at each place where Eliphaz uses the question form in this way.

Bildad says in his response in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:5\">8:5</a> that it is actually Job who should be seeking God diligently. To help your readers appreciate how Bildad is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Bildad’s expression <strong>seek diligently</strong> the same way that you translated it when Job used it in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job7:21\">7:21</a>.</p><h3>Quotation within a quotation</h3><p>In his speech, Bildad encourages Job to consider the wisdom of their ancestors. In verses 11–22, he may be quoting from traditional teachings. Notes suggest the possibility of punctuating these verses as a secondary quotation if your language might naturally put one direct quotation inside another.</p>",

In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:5\">8:5</a>, Bildad told Job that he should appeal to God. In response, Job protests in this chapter that a human being cannot appeal to God.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter</h2><h3>Litany</h3><p>In verses 5–10, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:</p><p>God is wise in heart and mighty in strength (Who has hardened himself against him and been whole?),</p><blockquote><p>the one removing mountains and they do not know, who overturns them in his anger, the one shaking the earth from its place and causing its pillars to tremble, the one speaking to the sun and it does not rise, and upon the stars he seals, stretching out the heavens by himself and treading on the waves of the sea, making the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south, doing great {things} until there is no searching and distinguished {things} until there is no number.</p></blockquote>",

For example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps19:4-Ps19:5\">Psalm 19:4–5</a> says that God has “pitched a tent for the sun” in the sky, from which the sun comes forth “like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps37:9\">135:7</a> refers similarly to God bringing the wind out of his “storehouses.” In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job37:9\">Job 37:9</a>, Elihu says that “the storm comes from its chamber.” So the reference here to <strong>the chambers of the south</strong> is likely to a place where, it was believed, God kept all the constellations of stars and from which God brought them out each night. You could retain the reference to these <strong>chambers</strong> in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is likely referring to the constellations themselves by association with their <strong>chambers</strong>.

The pronoun “you” is singular in verses 7–8 because Job is addressing Zophar. Use the plural and singular forms in these places if your language marks that distinction.</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter</h2><h3>Litany</h3><p>In verses 13–24, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:</p><blockquote><p>With him {are} wisdom and might; to him {are} counsel and understanding. Behold, he breaks down, and it is not rebuilt; he closes upon a man, and it is not opened. Behold, he withholds the waters and they dry up, and he sends them out and they overthrow the land. With him {are} strength and prudence; to him {are} the one straying and the one causing to stray; the one leading counselors away naked, and he makes judges foolish. He removes the bond of kings and he wraps a cloth around their loins; the one leading priests away naked, and the incumbent ones he overthrows, the one removing the lip {that is} to the ones being trusted, and he takes away the discernment of the elders, the one pouring contempt on nobles, and the belt of the mighty ones he loosens, the one revealing deep things out of darkness, and he brings dark shadow into the light, the one magnifying nations, and he destroys them; the one enlarging nations, and he exiles them, the one removing a heart from the leaders of the people of the earth; he causes them to wander in a wasteland {with} no path. They grope in darkness and not in light; he makes them wander like a drunkard.</p></blockquote>",

He asks God to stop punishing him and to reveal any sins that are causing God to punish him with such great suffering.</p></li></ul><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><p>##Translation Issues in This Chapter</p><h3>singular and plural “you”</h3><p>The words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are all plural in verses 1–19 because in those verses Job is addressing his three friends. These forms are singular in verses 20–28 because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the appropriate forms in these different parts of the chapter.</p><h3>“lift his face” (verse 8), “hide your face” (verse 24)</h3><p>These expressions reflect a cultural practice. In this culture, the subject of a king would look humbly down at the ground when he came into the king’s presence. If the king was pleased with him, the king would “lift his face,” that is, get him to look up (for example, with a finger under his chin, or with a verbal command) to indicate that he could look at the king directly. In this way the king would be showing that he favored this subject. A reference to lifting someone’s face came to mean showing favoritism towards that person. That is the meaning in verse 8, where Job says that his friends are not considering his case fairly but instead showing partiality towards God. Similarly, if someone “hid his face” from someone (that is, turned his face away so that he was not looking at the person), that would be a sign that he was not pleased with the person. The expression “hide the face” came to mean “show disfavor,” even if someone was not literally looking away from someone else. That is what Job means in verse 24 when he asks God, “Why do you hide your face?” Notes to these verses suggest ways of translating these expressions.</p>",

Sometimes he is more hopeful about it, and at other times he is less hopeful about it. In your translation, reflect what he is feeling and saying. It is not necessary to adjust his words in order to make them a confident proclamation about the resurrection.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>singular and plural “you”</h3><p>The words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation.</p><h3>“man” in a generic sense</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, Job uses the word “man” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, such as “people,” “mortals,” or “humans.”</p>",

In verses 1–6, Job complains that his friends have not helped him with their advice. In verses 7–22, Job describes how he feels God has made him suffer. Job briefly addresses God directly in verses 7 and 8.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>“witness,” “advocate,” and “intercessor”</h3><p>In verses 19–21, Job describes the need for someone to plead his case to God in heaven. This is likely the same figure whom Job calls his “redeemer” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:25\">19:25</a>. Although Job does not seem to be giving a prophecy knowingly about the Messiah, the role that he describes closely parallels the way that Jesus intercedes for people in heaven.

As Eliphaz did in his second speech to Job in chapter 15, Bildad speaks more strongly to Job in this speech than he did in his first speech. Using much of the same language that Job used in chapters 16 and 17, Bildad defends himself and the other two friends and warns Job that God will punish him severely if he continues to be wicked (as Bildad believes him to be).</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p>",

Job believes that even if God is treating him unfairly now, God will ultimately do the right thing. Job does not understand that God is actually not treating him unfairly. But the faith and confidence that he nevertheless has in God are remarkable.

    "content": "<h1>Job 20 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter is the second speech of Job’s friend Zophar. In this chapter, Zophar speaks more strongly to Job than he did the first time spoke to him.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Zophar answering Job with his own words</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job7:8\">7:8</a>, as Job was appealing to God, he said, “The eye of the one seeing me will not regard me; your eyes will be on me, but I will not exist.” Zophar says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job20:9\">20:9</a> about the wicked person, “The eye that saw him will not continue.” Job said in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job7:10\">7:10</a> of himself as a mortal person, “He will not return again to his house, and his place will not know him again.” Zophar says of the wicked person in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job20:9\">20:9</a>, “his place will no longer observe him.” In both instances Zophar is suggesting that Job himself is a wicked person, using Job’s own words.</p><p>Similarly, Zophar says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job20:27\">20:27</a> of the wicked person that “the heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will raise itself up against him” as a witness. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job16:18\">16:18</a>, Job called upon the earth to see that he received justice, and in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job16:19\">16:19</a>, Job said that he had an advocate in the heavens. So Zophar is likely answering Job once again in his own words, implying that Job himself is a wicked person of the type that he has been describing in his speech.</p><p>To help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate what Zophar says in these instances similarly to the way you translated what Job said earlier.</p><h3>Indelicate images that Zophar uses</h3><p>As noted above, Zophar speaks strongly to Job in this speech. He uses a couple of images drawn from bodily functions that people in your culture might consider indelicate to include in a Bible translation. If so, you could use comparable images. Zophar says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job20:7\">20:7</a> of the wicked person, “he will perish forever like his dung.” You could refer to something else that disappears completely, saying, for example, “he will perish forever like the dust that the wind blows away.” Zophar says of the wicked person in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job20:15\">20:15</a>, “He swallows wealth, but he will vomit it.” You might say instead something such as, “Though he may become rich, he will lose all his money.”</p>",

Job says in verse 19 of this chapter that this is what his three friends believe. However, while people’s sins may have consequences for their children and descendants, God does not punish people directly for their parents’ or ancestors’ sins. Be sure that this is clear in your translation.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>The adjective “wicked” as a noun</h3><p>In verses 7, 16, 17, and 28, Job uses the adjective “wicked” as a noun to mean wicked people in general. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase such as “wicked people.”</p>",

Job’s response continues in the next chapter.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Legal proceeding</h3><p>In this chapter, Job speaks of making a legal case to prove his innocence to God. As a note to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:3\">9:3</a> explains, in this culture, people typically presented such cases to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party in a dispute would question the other party in the presence of the leaders, and the leaders would then discuss the case and decide which party was guilty and which party was innocent. However, the Bible indicates that judges would also travel around from place to place and hear cases. For example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam7:16-1Sam7:17\">1 Samuel 7:16–17</a> says that Samuel “went around to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all those places.” Job is envisioning God serving as this kind of judge and hearing his case. In your translation, express his language in such a way that readers who are familiar with the legal process in your own culture will recognize what Job is saying.</p><h2>Translation issues in This chapter</h2><h3>“he,” “him,” and “his”</h3><p>The pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to God throughout this chapter. The UST models how a translation may say “God” regularly in order to make this clear.</p><h3>“my hand” or “his hand” (23:2)</h3><p>In verse 2, Hebrew manuscripts read “my hand.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible into other languages say “his hand,” and some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the readingof the ULT.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Job 24 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter is the continuation of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response began in the previous chapter.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>God’s judgment of wicked people</h3><p>In verses 1–17, Job protests that God does not judge wicked people. He lists many oppressive things that wicked people do to vulnerable, innocent people, and he complains that God acts as if there were nothing wrong with those things. But in verses 18–24, Job then describes how God actually does judge wicked people. There is an explanation for this apparent contradiction. In the speech as a whole, Job is saying that he knows God will judge wicked people in the end, but it is very distressing to him that God does not judge and punish them now in order to keep them from continuing to oppress vulnerable people. In your translation, you can use language that shows that Job firmly believes what he says in both parts of the chapter, since it is actually consistent for him to say both that God seemingly does not judge wicked people now and that God ultimately will judge wicked people in the end. This is not a contradiction, it is a paradox, and the Bible speaks of it in other passages as well. For example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl8:11\">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a> says that because God does not immediately punish people who do wrong, people feel that they can get away with doing wrong. But Ecclesiastes goes on to say in the next verse that even if a sinner might do a hundred evil things and live a long time, it is still better to obey God.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Changing referents of “they”</h3><p>Job uses the word “they” throughout this chapter to mean both wicked people and the poor people whom they exploit. He does not often indicate when he changing the referent of the word. Notes indicate the referent in each verse. In your translation, to be helpful to your readers, you may wish to specify “wicked people” or “poor people” each time the referent changes.</p>",

It is also much shorter than the three speeches that Eliphaz has given to this point in the book and the two speeches that Zophar has given. The likely explanation is that Job’s friends are running out of things to say to him. Indeed, Zophar does not give a third speech at all. The narrator says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job32:3\">32:3</a> that the three friends “found no answer” for Job’s arguments. The brevity of Bildad’s third speech and the absence of a third speech by Zophar dramatize this. Since the narrator eventually offers an explanation, it would not be necessary to put an explanation in your translation at the end of this chapter such as, “And that was all that Job’s friends had to say to him.”</p><h3>God’s holiness and human sinfulness</h3><p>In this short speech, Bildad describes God’s holiness and human sinfulness. While the points he makes are accurate, they are not convincing for Job, because he has actually been righteous. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25840\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Holy</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26240\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Sin</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26177\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Righteous</span>)</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Bildad using the words of Eliphaz</h3><p>Although Bildad speaks only briefly, he repeats significant phrases from Eliphaz’s first and second speeches. Bildad asks in verse 4, “So how will a man be righteous with God? Or how will one born of a woman be pure?” Eliphaz had asked similarly in 4:17, “Will a man be more righteous than God? If a man will be more pure than his Maker?” and in 15:14, “What is man, that he should be pure, or that one born of a woman should be righteous?” To show this, it would be helpful to use the same wording in your translation of 25:4 that you used in 4:17 and 15:14.</p>",

Bildad had spoken briefly of the greatness of God. Job shows that he is a truly godly man who appreciates God’s greatness by describing it in this chapter at greater length and in more eloquent language. Job told the friends in 12:3 that he had just as much wisdom as they did, and he demonstrates that in this chapter.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter</h2><h3>Litany</h3><p>In verses 7–9, Job makes a series of statements about God that have a similar form. A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litany in chapter 12. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make each verse in the litany a separate sentence. For example, you could begin verse 7, “God stretches out.” Notes to verses 7–9 offer further suggestions.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Reference of “he,” “him,” and “his”</h3><p>The pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” all refer to God throughout this chapter. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “God” or “God’s” at regular intervals for clarity.</p>",

In this part of his speech, Job discusses how people can obtain wisdom. Both he and his friends have stressed the importance of wisdom (for example, in 12:2, 15:8, and 26:3). Job says at the end of this eloquent discussion, “Behold, the fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to turn from evil is understanding.” The implication is that Job, who prizes wisdom so much, would not have disrespected God, committed evil, and thus missed out on having wisdom. So in this chapter, Job gives another important defense of his innocence.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Reference of “it” in verses 13–18</h3><p>Job introduces the subject of “wisdom” in verse 12. Then, from verse 14 through to the end of the chapter, he refers to wisdom most of the time with the pronouns “it” and “its.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “wisdom” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do this at various places.</p>",

In this chapter, Job recalls the honor he enjoyed and the influence he exercised within his community before he suffered so many misfortunes.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter</h2><h3>Litany</h3><p>In verses 2–6, Job makes a series of statements about what his life was like before his present troubles. He expresses a wish in verse 2 that his life could be like this again, and in verses 3–6 he offers a series of descriptions that each begin with “when” or “as that.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litany in chapter 12. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make each verse in the litany a separate sentence. For example, you could begin verse 3, “At that time.”</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Reference of “they” in verses 21–25</h3><p>Job uses “they” in verses 21–25 as an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify a general referent such as “people” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do that at various places.</p>",

Typically he uses a statement that begins with “if” to suggest something he might have done wrong, and he then uses a statement that uses verbal forms such as “may” or “let” to wish that he would receive an appropriate punishment if he has indeed committed such a sin. In some cases, rather than wish for punishment, Job gives a reason why he would not have committed the sin he has described. In some other cases, Job makes only the “if” statement, leaving the rest of the conditional statement to be inferred. Notes throughout the chapter indicate how Job responds to each of the “if” statements that he makes.</p><p>A series of similar statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litanies in chapters 9, 12, 26, and 29. (See: rc://<em>/ta/man/translate/figs-litany and rc://</em>/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula)</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Job’s understanding of appropriate punishment for sin</h3><p>In this chapter, Job insists that he has been righteous by wishing aloud that he would receive the just punishment for any crimes that he may have committed. In most cases, Job himself would suffer the punishment that he describes. But in verses 9 and 10, Job says that if he has committed adultery with another man’s wife, then may other men have sexual relations with his wife. It seems that Job is wishing that God would punish his wife for something that he himself had done. Since the book describes Job as a wise and righteous, it appears that readers are supposed to consider that this would be a just punishment, but it does not seem to be just or fair. One way to understand this may be to consider that Job is saying that if he has been unfaithful to his wife, then may his wife be unfaithful to him in return. This is not the ideal that the Bible as a whole teaches. As Christians, we are not supposed to take revenge on others by doing to them what they have done to us. But in this specific context, in which Job is swearing oaths to guarantee his innocence, having his wife be unfaithful to him if he had been unfaithful to her would be a punishment that fit the crime, and Job is insisting on his innocence by saying that he is prepared to receive the punishments that fit any crimes he has committed.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Job 33 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu addresses Job directly. He invites Job to listen to him, summarizes what Job has said, and tells Job that he is wrong that God does not respond to people. Elihu says that God speaks to people in dreams to warn them not to keep sinning. He says that God also uses sickness to correct people. The implications are that Job’s sufferings are a warning from God not to sin; they are not a punishment from God for sins that Job has committed. In that sense, as Elihu says at the end of the chapter, Job has been right and his friends have been wrong about what has been happening to Job.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>ransom</h3><p>In verse 24, Elihu describes how God may say of a person who is suffering because of his sin, “I have found a ransom.” The term “ransom” can describe a payment that is made in exchange for someone’s freedom. The term “redeem,” which Elihu uses earlier in that verse, can similarly mean to make a payment in order to have someone set free. However, in this context, the term “ransom” seems to describe instead a valuable consideration, not necessarily a monetary one, that provides the grounds for sparing someone from punishment. Be sure that it is clear in your translation of this verse that God is not saying that he is going to make a payment to someone else on behalf of the suffering person.</p><p>A further implication seems to be that the person whom Elihu is describing has repented because of his sufferings after an interpreting angel has explained to him the change needed in his actions. This repentance shows that the person has responded positively to God’s initiatives to get him to stop living in the wrong way and to start living in the right way once again. Be sure that it is also clear in your translation of verse 24 that there is nothing that the person has done to redeem or ransom himself. As Elihu says, God “is gracious to him.” It is God who brings the sickness into the person’s life to “chasten” him, and it is God who sends the angel to warn and admonish the person, and so the person is spared from punishment through the actions of God.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>“words” meaning speaking or what a person says</h3><p>As in chapter 32, many times in this chapter Elihu uses the term “words” to mean speaking or what a person says by using words. Notes suggest ways to translate the term “words” in these various individual contexts.</p><h3>reference of “you” and “your”</h3><p>Throughout this chapter, Elihu uses the pronouns “you” and “your” to address Job individually, so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.</p><h3>“man” and “men” with generic meaning</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, Elihu uses the words “man” and “men” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Notes suggest translation possibilities at various places (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26690\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">When Masculine Words Include Women</span>).</p><h3>“seals their correction” or “terrifies them with warnings” (verse 16)</h3><p>In verse 16, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “seals their correction.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “terrifies them with warnings,” and some translations say that. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Job 34 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks first to Job’s friends and others who may be listening, then from verse 16 onward he addresses Job directly, and then he speaks again to the others about Job starting in verse 34.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Elihu speaking harshly about Job</h3><p>It may be puzzling to your readers that while Elihu promises Job in 33:7 that he will be gentle with him, in this chapter, in verses 7–8 and 35, Elihu speaks very harshly about Job. However, this is really a matter of interpretation rather than translation, so it is not necessary to offer an explanation within the text of your translation.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Elihu quoting Job and his friends</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, Elihu directly quotes Job or his friends. He does this to affirm what the friends said and to challenge what Job said. To help your readers appreciate that Elihu is doing this, you may wish to translate his expressions the same way you translated them when Job or his friends used them. In 34:3, Elihu quotes what Job said in 12:11. In 34:5, Elihu quotes what Job said in 27:2. In 34:6, Elihu quotes what Job said in 6:4, 16:13, and 27:4. In 34:7, Elihu quotes what Eliphaz said in 15:16. In 34:12, Elihu quotes what Bildad said in 8:3.</p><h3>“man” and “men” with generic meaning</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, Elihu uses the words “man” and “men” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Notes suggest ways in which you might do this. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26690\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">When Masculine Words Include Women</span>.)</p><h3>“For” at the start of a verse introducing a reason</h3><p>Several times in this chapter, Elihu says “For” at the beginning of a verse to introduce the reason for something he said in the previous verse. Elihu does this in verses 3, 5, 9, 11, 21, and 37. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could refer back more explicitly to the previous verse in order to show what Elihu is doing. The UST models ways to do this in each case. (“For” at the beginning of verse 23 introduces a new consideration, as the UST also illustrates.) (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26749\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">Connecting Words and Phrases</span>.)</p>",

In this chapter, Elihu speaks primarily to Job, although in the last verse he speaks about Job to the others who are present.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Does God not benefit when humans do what is right?</h3><p>In verses 6–8, Elihu tells Job that whether he is good or bad has no effect on God; that only affects other people. Elihu probably means that God does not owe Job anything for being good and that God does not have to defend himself against Job being bad. But if what Elihu says is taken in a general sense, then it does not express the full teaching of the Bible. Elsewhere the Bible says that God is delighted when people obey him and that God grieves when people sin, knowing the destructive effects that this will have. God is glorified when people acknowledge that humans flourish when they obey his commandments. Elihu, like Job’s friends, says things that are true to a certain extent but that do not fully express the counsel of God as found in the Bible as a whole.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>reference of “you” and “your”</h3><p>Throughout this chapter, Elihu uses the pronouns “you” and “your” to address Job individually, so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In verse 3, in the quotation by Elihu, the pronoun “you” is also singular because Job is using it to address God.</p>",

Biblical scholars have offered a variety of explanations of what Elihu says in each verse. Published versions of the Bible differ significantly from one another in their renderings of this material. The ULT seeks to offer a consistent and reasonable translation of these verses. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in several places in the way that it translates these verses. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the readings that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT.</p><h3>singular “you” and “your”</h3><p>The pronouns “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Elihu is addressing Job. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use singular forms in your translation.</p><h3>“hear” meaning “obey”</h3><p>In verses 10, 11, and 12, Elihu uses the term “hear” in a specific sense to mean “obey.” You may wish to use the term “obey” in each instance in your translation.</p>",

Elihu continues to use the storm that is gathering and approaching to describe God’s great power. He concludes by telling Job that he should not expect to be able to speak with such a powerful God.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>singular “you” in verses 15–19</h3><p>The pronoun “you” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular in verses 15–19 because Elihu is addressing Job. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use singular forms in your translation.</p><h3>The nature of the questions in verses 15–18</h3><p>Elihu asks Job a series of questions in verses 15–18. He may want Job to try to answer these questions so that Job will have to admit that he does not understand what God does. So these could be actual questions that Elihu is using to get information, specifically, these admissions from Job. Alternatively, Elihu may be using the question form for emphasis. A note to verse 15 suggests two possible ways in which you could translate the question there. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in verses 15–18.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Job 38 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter is the beginning of Yahweh’s response to Job. His response continues through chapter 41.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><p>In this chapter, Yahweh begins asking Job a series of questions in order to show that Job does not understand the workings of the created world. Yahweh asks questions about the earth in verses 4–20, with a summary challenge to Job in verse 21. Yahweh then asks questions about the sky in verses 22–38. He starts asking questions about animals and birds in verse 39; this part of his speech continues into the next chapter.</p><p>The implication is that if Job does not understand and cannot explain how God makes things work in the visible creation, he certainly does not understand and cannot explain what God is doing as he works in unseen, mysterious ways to accomplish his purposes in the lives of people and over the course of human history.</p><p>When God comes to Job in the storm and responds to his questions, it becomes obvious that Elihu was wrong to say that God would not meet with Job. This shows God’s generosity to Job in granting him an interview as he requested, even though in the interview, God has to humble Job by demonstrating how little he actually knows.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Yahweh’s description of the creation</h3><p>In this chapter, Yahweh describes the earth, sea, and sky according to the way the people of Job’s culture understood them. For example, in verse 16 Yahweh speaks of “springs” at the bottom of the sea that provide it with water. In verse 22, he speaks of “storehouses” in the sky where snow and hail are kept. In some parts of the chapter, these references occur within poetic images, such as the image in verses 4–6 of the earth as a building with “foundations” or the image in verses 12–13 of the dawn grasping the “edges” of the earth and shaking it. But in other places, the references do not occur within poetic images. In such places, Yahweh’s questions to Job, which demonstrate the limits of Job’s knowledge, depend for their force on these features being real, even though they do not correspond to the creation as we would describe it today. We may consider that Yahweh is using terminology that Job and the others who are listening would understand in order to communicate moral and spiritual insights to them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate these descriptions of the natural world from an ancient perspective with equivalent expressions that use terms that reflect your own culture’s perspective. Notes suggest how you might do this in various places. For example, a note to verse 16 suggests speaking of the “bottom of the sea” rather than of the “springs of the sea.”</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>The nature of the questions in verses 4–41</h3><p>Yawheh asks Job a series of questions in verses 4–41. He may want Job to try to answer these questions so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. So these could be actual questions that Yahweh is using to get information, specifically, the information from Job that he does not know the answers. Alternatively, Yahweh may be using the question form for emphasis. A note to verse 4 suggests two possible ways in which you could translate the question there. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in this chapter.</p>",

Yahweh began to ask Job questions about animals and birds in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:39\">38:39</a>; he continues to do that in this chapter.</p><p>The implication continues to be that if Job does not understand and cannot explain how God makes things work in the visible creation, he certainly does not understand and cannot explain what God is doing as he works in unseen, mysterious ways to accomplish his purposes in the lives of people and over the course of human history.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>The nature of Yahweh’s questions to Job</h3><p>As in the previous chapter, Yahweh may want Job to try to answer the questions he is asking so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternatively, Yahweh may be using the question form for emphasis. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in this chapter.</p>",

While this animal was known in the time of Job, its exact identity is now uncertain. You may therefore wish to use the name Behemoth in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, rather than trying to specify a particular animal that Yahweh is describing. The UST models this approach.</p><h2>Special Concepts in This Chapter</h2><h3>Justice</h3><p>In verse 8, Yahweh asks Job whether he wishes to decide what is right. and then in the next verse, Yahweh asks Job whether he has great power. However, Yahweh is not suggesting that might makes right. Rather, he is asking Job whether he has the might to make things right, as he then describes in verses 10–14. In verse 10, the terms ”majesty,“ ”greatness,“ ”glory,“ and ”splendor“ describe moral qualities, not simply power. See if you have terms available in your language that can convey this meaning in your translation.</p>",

    "content": "<h1>Job 41 General Notes</h1><h2>Structure and Formatting</h2><p>This chapter is the conclusion of Yahweh’s response to Job.</p><p>The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.</p><h2>Translation Issues in This Chapter</h2><h3>Leviathan</h3><p>In the previous chapter, to help Job recognize what a small and insignificant place he occupied within creation, Yahweh told him to consider a great creature named Behemoth. In this chapter, for the same purpose, Yahweh tells Job to consider another great creature that he calls Leviathan.</p><p>As the General Introduction to Job explains, ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean, which they called the “sea monster.” They also used the names Leviathan and Rahab to describe this creature. While it seems to have been known in the time of Job, its exact identity is uncertain today. And so it may be best to use the name Leviathan in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, rather than trying to specify a particular animal that Yahweh is describing. The UST models this approach.</p><h3>Yahweh answering Job with his own words</h3><p>In several places in this chapter, Yahweh alludes to Job’s opening speech, in which Job cursed the day of his birth, by using the same language that Job did. In verse 10, Yahweh speaks of awakening Leviathan, as Job did in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:8\">3:8</a>. In verse 18, Yahweh speaks of “the eyelids of the dawn,” meaning the first rays of the rising sun, as Job did in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:9\">3:9</a>. In verse 30, Yahweh speaks of a “shard,” a piece of broken pottery, such as Job took to scrape his skin, as <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:8\">2:8</a> describes. In each case, these are the only two occurrences of these words or phrases in the book. As Yahweh concludes his own speech, he is going all the way back to the beginnings of Job’s troubles and to the first concerns that he expressed in order to address everything that Job has said throughout the book. To help your readers appreciate what Yahweh is doing, you may wish to translate his expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier.</p>",

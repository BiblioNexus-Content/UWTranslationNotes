There are different views among biblical scholars regarding how this book is structured and who is speaking in different places, and therefore how it should be outlined. The outline above attempts to offer a reasonable and general way of outlining this book but there are other possible ways this book could be outlined.

### What is the Song of Songs about?

The Song of Songs is a poem or a series of poems that celebrate love and intimacy between a man and a woman. Jews traditionally have interpreted the book as a picture of God’s love for his people Israel. Until the 1800’s the main view among Christians was that this book is primarily a picture of love between Christ and his bride, Christians. Since the 1800’s the more common view of the meaning of this book among Christians is that it is a poem or a series of poems that give a beautiful picture of love between a man and a woman. Many Christians also think that even though the main meaning of this poem is to give a beautiful portrayal of romantic love between a man and a woman, that there are lessons in this book to be learned about God’s love for his bride, Christians.

### Who wrote the Song of Songs?

The first verse of the book (“The song of songs, which is of Solomon”) gives the idea that King Solomon of Israel wrote it. However, there are different possible ways to interpret the meaning of this title. A translation note for this verse discusses the different possible meanings.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

This book is traditionally titled “Song of Songs,” which means the very best song, or “Song of Solomon.” It may also be called “Songs of Love,” “Great Poems of Love,” or “The Love Songs of Solomon.” (See: How to Translate Names)

Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts
-------------------------------------------------

### What place do the descriptions of sexual behavior have in the Song of Songs?

The Song of Songs approves of sexual behavior expressing love between a husband his wife.

Part 3: Important Translation Issues
------------------------------------

### How many characters are in the Song of Songs?

The two main characters in this book are the man and the woman, who love each other. In [8:8–9](https://ref.ly/Song8:8-Song8:9) the woman’s brothers speak among themselves and in different places throughout the book a group of women called the “daughters of Jerusalem,” speak or are spoken to. However, it is possible that the group of women is not real and that the woman only imagined them and that they are put into the poem for poetic effect.

Some interpreters believe there may be more characters than these, but this is not certain. The ULT and UST versions recognize only the man, the woman, the group of women (and possibly a group of friends in some parts), and the woman’s brothers.

### What are the lines in the UST about people speaking?

The Song of Songs is a poem that shows the thoughts and words of a man, a woman, the woman’s friends, and the woman’s brothers. Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. So to help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking.

Before each speech, the UST has a header which identifies the speaker and often the audience in ways like this: “The woman speaking to the women of Jerusalem,” “The woman speaking to the man,” “The man speaking to the woman,” or “The woman speaking to herself.” Translators are encouraged to include these ways of identifying the speaker and the audience, and to format them differently from the scripture text. The translators should also include an initial note explaining that these explanations are not actually part of the text of scripture.

There are different views among Bible scholars about who the man is who is in love with the woman, whether it is a shepherd boy or king Solomon or whether both speak in this book at various times and are competing for the woman’s love. The headers in the UST will indicate when them man is speaking or being spoken to with headers such as “The man speaking to the woman he loves” and “The woman speaking to the man she loves,” but will not indicate the identity of the man.

### How should one translate the Song of Songs if the readers will view certain terms as coarse, vulgar, or improper?

Readers might consider many images or forms appearing in the Song of Songs as improper when translated. The translator should try to avoid offensive language if possible, by using expressions that will not cause offense. (See: Euphemism)

### How do I translate metaphors and similes in this book?

There are many metaphors and similes in this book. These figures of speech are used to add poetic beauty and emotional effect, however their meaning is sometimes unclear and sometimes it is unclear whether or not there is a sexual meaning intended or a double meaning (both a literal and a sexual meaning). However, though meanings are often unclear, it is not always necessary to clarify the meaning and often ambiguity in translation is best. You can translate the words as they are written in order to avoid committing to a specific meaning. (See: Metaphor)

### Translating terms of endearment

The word the ULT translates as “my beloved” occurs 26 times in this book and each time it occurs the woman uses it to refer to the man she loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout this book. The word the ULT translates as “my darling” appears nine times in this book. Each time it occurs the man uses it to refer the woman he loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout the book.

Song of Songs 1 General Notes
=============================

Important figures of speech in this chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Metaphors

In the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: Metaphor)

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### The lines indicating who is speaking and who is being spoken to.

Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. So to help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking. Before each speech, the UST has a header which identifies the speaker and the audience. You may wish to do the same in your translation.

### “I am black”

In the ancient Near East, rich people usually had lighter skin because they did not need to work outside in the sun. This young woman had to work outside in the sun, and her skin became dark as a result and this is why she says “I am black” in [1:5–6](https://ref.ly/Song1:5-Song1:6).

**"but lovely"**

Here, the word **but** is introducing a contrast.

## Song of Solomon 1:5 (#3) (id: 278773)

**"daughters of Jerusalem"**

The woman is using the possessive form to poetically describe where the young women (whom she calls **daughters**) live. The phrase **daughters of Jerusalem** refers to the young women who were from the city of Jerusalem (These are probably the same women as the “marriageable women” in [1:3](https://ref.ly/Song1:3) and the women referred to as “they” in [1:4](https://ref.ly/Song1:4)). If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could indicate the association between these young women and **Jerusalem** in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “daughters from Jerusalem” or “young women from Jerusalem”

**""like the tents of Kedar,"**

The Kedar were a tribe of people who used black goat skins to make their tents, thus their tents were dark in color. The woman is comparing her skin to these tents which were dark in color. The phrase **the curtains of Solomon** refers to the curtains in Solomon’s palace which were very beautiful. The point of the first comparison is that the woman’s skin was dark (referring back to and further describing the word **black**) and the point of the second comparison is that the woman was beautiful (referring back to and further describing the word **lovely**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons from your culture or you could retain these similes and express these meanings as plainly as possible. Alternate translation: “like the dark color of the tents of the people of the tribe Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon’s palace” or “as dark as the color of the tents of Kedar, as beautiful as the curtains in Solomon’s palace”

**"my vineyard that {is} mine, I have not kept"**

The woman is probably using the phrase **my vineyard** to refer to her complexion. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my skin, I have not protected from the sun” or “my complexion, I have not protected from the sun”

**"where do you graze"**

**""where do you graze?"**

The phrase **where do you graze** and the phrase **Where do you make your flocks lie down at noontime** mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying very similar things twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “Where do you pasture your flocks in the middle of the day”

**""For why should I be like a woman who covers herself"**

The woman is not asking for information, but is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate her words as a statement, a request, or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I do not want to be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions” or “Please do not let me be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions” or “Tell me so that I will not be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions”

**""For why should I be like a woman who covers herself"**

In the authors culture women who were prostitutes often covered their faces with a veil so that people would not recognize them. It would not be normal for a young unmarried woman to be wandering among shepherds and the woman did not want to be mistaken for a prostitute. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “Tell me where you pasture your flocks so that I will not need to wander around among the flocks of your companions like a prostitute when I am looking for you” or “For why should I be like a prostitute who covers herself with a veil and wanders about beside the flocks of your companions”

The reason the word **we** is used here could be: (1\) because the man is saying that he will have someone make the **Earrings of gold** for him. The man is not including the woman so **we** would be exclusive. Your may language require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “Earring of gold I will have someone make for you” or “I will pay someone to make earring of gold for you” (2\) because he is using a commonly accepted use of the plural in his language and expects the woman to understand that he means “I.” Alternate translation: “Earrings of gold I will make for you” (3\) because a group of people are speaking here and not the man.

## Song of Solomon 1:14 (#2) (id: 278814)

**""A cluster of henna blossoms {is} my beloved to me,"**

Here, **vineyards of En Gedi** is probably a reference to the woman’s body because at that time **vineyards** were often used to convey a sexual meaning and because the phrase **in the vineyards of Engedi** is in parallel to the phrase in the previous verse in which the woman refers to her body by saying that her “beloved” is like a “bundle of myrrh“ which “stays” (the night) “between” her “breasts.” In this verse the woman makes a comparison between the pleasurable experience of the smell of henna blossoms and her enjoyment of having the man she loves near her body. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a simile to show the comparison. Because the woman describes her body in a poetic way with images, it is recommended that you either maintain these images or select images from your context and language that communicate the same concepts. Alternate translation: “I enjoy being near my beloved’s body like I enjoy the smell of the henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi” or “I delight in my beloved being near my body like I enjoy the smell of the henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi”

Song of Songs 2 General Notes
=============================

Important figures of speech in this chapter
-------------------------------------------

### The woman and man complement each other by using metaphors and similes

In 2:1 the woman uses a metaphor to tell the man she loves that she thinks she is common like a flower that grows on the plains or a lily that grows in the valleys. The man responds in 2:2 by using a simile to tell her how special he thinks she is when compared to other women. She then uses a simile in 2:3 to tell him how special she thinks he is compared to other men. When translating these verses one will need to pay close attention to the translation notes and the UST in order to understand the meaning.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Chiasm

Hebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary a device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB\-BA sequence. In [Song of Songs 2:14](https://ref.ly/Song2:14) the author uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates this verse as “show me **your appearance**, make me hear **your voice**, for **your voice** {is} sweet, and **your appearance** {is} lovely” (the repeated phrases are highlighted for the purpose of illustration). Notice that the phrases “your appearance” and “your voice” are repeated in this verse and they are repeated in an AB\-BA sequence: “your appearance...your voice...your voice...your appearance.”

* **Associated Passages:** SNG 2:1

## Song of Solomon 2:1 (#1) (id: 278827)

**""I {am} a flower of Sharon,"**

The woman is speaking of herself as if she is two different types of flowers in order to make a comparison between herself and these flowers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, explain the comparison, or use a simile as modeled by the UST. The reason the woman compares herself to these wildflowers is to express that she thinks she has only common beauty and is no more attractive than other young women her age. Alternate translation: “I am as common as a wildflower of Sharon or a lily of the valleys” or “My beauty is as common as a wildflower in Sharon or a lily of the valleys”

## Song of Solomon 2:1 (#2) (id: 278828)

**"am} a flower of"**

The original word which the ULT translates as **flower** refers to a specific type of flower which grows on the ground. The exact type of flower that the original word refers to cannot be known with certainty so you could use the name of a pretty wildflower in your area or you could use a general term as modeled by the ULT.

## Song of Solomon 2:1 (#3) (id: 278829)

**"Sharon"**

**Sharon** was the name of a specific plain (a flat area) and the word itself refers to a flat, wide area and so by using the word **Sharon** the woman is probably referring to “plains” in general and expressing that she is like a wildflower that grows on the plains. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST.

## Song of Solomon 2:1 (#4) (id: 278830)

**""I {am} a flower of Sharon,"**

The phrase **a flower of Sharon** and the phrase **a lily of the valleys** mean very similar things. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying very similar things twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “I am a wildflower that grows in the plains and the valleys”

**""Like a lily among thorns,"**

The man compares the woman he loves to **a lily among thorns**. The point of this comparison is that in the same way that **a lily** is much more beautiful than **thorns** so the woman is much more beautiful than the other young women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “You my darling, are much more beautiful than all other women”

An **apple tree** is a tree that produces **apples**, a round, pleasant tasting fruit that is about the size of an adult human’s fist and has a pleasant smell. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of fruit, you could use the name of a similar fruit in your area that grows on trees or you could use a more general term. (Bible scholars are not totally certain that the word the ULT translates as **apple** refers to an apple. It could refer to an apricot or another type of fruit so if your readers are not familiar with apples but they are familiar with apricots you could “apricot” instead of a general term.

**""In his shadow I took delight, and I sat,"**

Here the woman continues speaking of the man as if he were **an apple tree**. The word **shadow** refers to the shade of an apple tree which would give protection from the sun and refreshment. To **sit** represents being near or in the presence of the man. The phrase **his fruit is sweet** means that he causes the woman to experience pleasurable feelings in a way that is comparable to eating sweet fruit. If it is possible in your language you should try to retain the images used here, or substitute a comparable image if needed. If you are not able to retain the metaphors without causing misunderstanding, you could use similes or state the meaning plainly.

In the author’s culture the phrase **house of wine** was used to refer to a location that people went for the purpose of drinking wine. The phrase does not necessarily indicate a **house** or building so here it could be referring a private location that the couple used as their meeting place, possibly the “house” (location) where they spent time together in the forest (described in [1:17](https://ref.ly/Song1:17)).

**""Sustain me with raisin cakes;"**

These two phrases mean very similar things. In the author’s culture both raisins and **apples** were believed to give people strength for love.The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if your readers are unfamiliar with raisins and/or **apples** and you do not have an equivalent food or foods that you could substitute for them here you could combine these two phrases into one and use a general expression. Alternate translation: “Sustain and refresh me with fruit” or “strengthen me with fruit” or “strengthen me for love with fruit”

The phrases **Sustain me** and **refresh me** are plural imperative forms in the original language. The woman is addressing the man using plural forms to show the intensity of her feelings. Your language may allow you to do the same thing. The ULT indicates the intensity that these two plural forms indicate by placing an exclamation point at the end of this verse. Use a natural form in your language for showing intensity of emotion.

**"the winter"**

In Israel **winter** is the time of year when it is cold and rains more heavily than during other seasons.

**""the winter has gone;"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

## Song of Solomon 2:15 (#1) (id: 278905)

**""Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes"**

Here, **the foxes** represent things that could harm the man and woman’s developing love relationship with each other. One interpretation is that the harmful things which **the foxes** symbolize are other men. Catching **the foxes** represents removing these harmful things or protecting against them. The term **vineyards** represents the love the man and woman have for each other. The phrase **in blossom** means that the love they have for each other is developing positively and growing, similar to how a plant blossoms and grows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this verse plainly. Alternate translation: “Get rid of the harmful things that hinder and ruin our relationship, for our relationship is blossoming” or “Remove the little things that destroy our growing relationship” or “There are other men who are like little foxes that ruin vineyards; do not allow those men to attack me”

## Song of Solomon 2:15 (#3) (id: 278907)

**"the foxes for us, the little foxes"**

Both **foxes** and jackals are land animals that are similar to small dogs and would ruin vineyards by digging up and eating the budding blossoms that could eventually produce grapes. If your readers would not be familiar with these animals and their habits, you could describe the animal you chose to use in your translation (a fox or a jackal) in general terms or use the name of something similar in your area.

She is using **lilies** to represent herself as she did in [2:1](https://ref.ly/Song2:1). Here, **the lilies** probably specifically represent the woman’s lips. The meaning here is that the man finds sustenance and enjoyment through being with the woman and kissing her lips. If it would help your readers, you could state the meaning plainly as modeled by the UST or you could explain the meaning in a footnote if you are using footnotes in your translation.

Song of Songs 3 General Notes
=============================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Longing

[3:1–3](https://ref.ly/Song3:1-Song3:3) describes the feeling of longing that the woman had for the man she loved and it describes her diligently seeking the man loved. [3:4](https://ref.ly/Song3:4) describes the woman finding the man that she loved and her response to finding him, holding onto him and bringing him to her mother’s house.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Whether [3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Song3:1-Song3:4) describe a dream, a real event or something imagined

Bible scholars do not know for certain whether the events described in [3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Song3:1-Song3:4) are real events or something that the woman dreamed in a dream or something that the woman imagined. Many Bible scholars think that [3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Song3:1-Song3:4) describe a dream. If you are using footnotes you may wish to explain this in a footnote or you could indicate in a section header whether you think this is a dream, a real event or something that the woman imagined. You could also use a general section header such as “The woman searches for the man she loves at night and finds him” which does not comment on whether this was a dream, a real event or something imagined.

* **Associated Passages:** SNG 3:1

## Song of Solomon 3:1 (#1) (id: 278919)

**"On my bed in the night"**

Because Bible scholars do not know if the events described in [3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Song3:1-Song3:4) describe real events or things that happened in a dream or things the woman imagined, you should not expand on or explain the phrase **On my bed in the night** in the actual text of your translation (by adding a phrase like “I dreamed I was” or “I imagined I was”) though you may wish to use a header or a footnote. See the section “Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter” in the Introduction to this chapter for more information.

**"in the night"**

In the original language the phrase **in the night** uses a plural form of **night** and could mean: (1\) that the woman sought the man during the night. Alternate translation: “during the night” (2\) that the woman sought the man throughout the night. Alternate translation: “throughout the night” or “all night long” (3\) that the woman sought the man on many nights. Alternate translation: “night after night” or “night upon night”

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. (2\) be a request for information. Alternate translation: “Who is it that I see arising from the wilderness like columns of smoke, fragrant smoke of myrrh and frankincense from all the powders of the merchant?”

**"coming up"**

The phrase **coming up** is used by the author because the group of people described is traveling **from the wilderness** to Jerusalem. They must travel upward in elevation in order to reach Jerusalem because **the wilderness** is low in the Jordan valley and Jerusalem is built on hills and is therefore high. Use a word or phrase that expresses moving upward in elevation. Alternate translation: “moving upward” or “arising”

## Song of Solomon - Chapter 4 Introduction (id: 718696)

Song of Songs 4 General Notes
=============================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Beauty

The man describes the woman he loves as the epitome of beauty and attractiveness in [4:1–4:5](https://ref.ly/Song4:1-Song4:5) and in [4:7](https://ref.ly/Song4:7).

### Feelings of longing to be with one’s lover who seems distant and temporarily inaccessible

In [4:8](https://ref.ly/Song4:8) the man speaks of the woman he loves as if she were far away from him and he invites her to “come with” him and “descend from” the height of three high places and be with him. The woman is not actually dwelling in these places but rather the man is using imaginative and poetic language to describe how he feels about being separated from her and to describe his desire to be with her. In [4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12) the man uses poetic language to describe the fact that the woman he loves is temporarily inaccessible.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### The Garden Metaphor

[4:12–5:1](https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1) is an extended metaphor. This metaphor is a conversation between the man and the woman he loves in which the man first compares the woman he loves to “a locked garden” (in [4:12–4:15](https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song4:15)) where many delightful things grow and then the woman responds by inviting the man to come to her garden in [4:16](https://ref.ly/Song4:16). The man then responds to her invitation in [5:1](https://ref.ly/Song5:1). The term **garden** is used as a metaphor for the woman in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12), in [4:16](https://ref.ly/Song4:16) (two times), and in [5:1](https://ref.ly/Song5:1). You should be consistent in how you translate the term “garden.” In [4:13](https://ref.ly/Song4:13) the man speaks of the woman’s body as “an orchard of pomegranate trees with delicious fruits” and then in [4:16](https://ref.ly/Song4:16) the woman invites the man to **come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit**. (See: Biblical Imagery — Extended Metaphors)

### The “sister” metaphor

The phrase **my sister** is used in 4:9; 4:10, 4:12, 5:1, and 5:2\. The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase the same way each of the five times it occurs in this book because the author uses it with the same meaning every time. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in 4:9 for more information regarding this phrase.

**"Your hair {is} like a flock of goats that hop down from {the} slopes of Gilead"**

Both the color and the motion of the woman’s **hair** is being compared to **a flock of goats that hop down from the slopes of Gilead**. Goats in Israel were black so the original readers would have understood this comparison to mean that the woman’s hair was black. Seen from a distance, a flock of black goats descending down from the high elevation of **Mount Gilead** would have created a majestic visual effect because the goats would have looked like one long flowing mass of black. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly these two points of comparison. Alternate translation: “Your black hair moves in graceful waves like a flock of black goats moving down the slopes of Mount Gilead” or “Your long black hair flows in graceful waves like a flock of black goats coming down the slopes of Mount Gilead”

She has not lost any of her teeth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. If it would help your readers you could also start a new sentence as modeled by the UST.

The woman’s lips are being compared to the color of scarlet thread and not to the thinness of the thread. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Also, if it would help your readers you could use a term for a material that is thicker than **thread** such as ribbon.

In the authors culture the number **a thousand** was often used to represent a very large, but not precise, amount. This is how the number is being used here. Alternate translation: “with many”

## Song of Solomon 4:4 (#7) (id: 278986)

**""a thousand shields hanging on it,"**

The phrase **all the shields of the warriors** is parallel to the statement **a thousand shields hanging on it** and adds the additional information that the **shields** belonged to **warriors**. Hebrew poetry often used this kind of parallel statement, in which the second line gives additional information, so it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect these two parallel phrases with “each of which” or “each one” in order to show that the second phrase is not repeating the first one, but rather is saying something additional. Alternate translation: “a thousand shields hanging on it, each of which belongs to the warriors” or “a thousand shields hanging on it, each one belonging to the warriors”

**""Your two breasts {are} like two fawns,"**

Here, the man compares the woman’s **two breasts** to two young twin gazelles that are grazing. The context does not explicitly indicate how exactly the woman’s **two breasts** are like two young gazelles so you could simply say that they resemble young gazelles or if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a general point of comparison between the woman’s **breasts** and the young gazelles such as their beauty as modeled by the UST.

**""I myself will go to the mountain of myrrh"**

The phrases **the mountain of myrrh** and **the hill of frankincense** are both metaphors that refer to the woman’s “breasts” (mentioned in the previous verse). The man is discreetly indicating that the woman’s breasts are pleasant smelling and that he wants to enjoy them (The man and the woman are now married). It would be good to retain this discreet and beautiful poetic imagery if possible. If you are using footnotes you could indicate what these two metaphors mean there. If you decide that it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning using a simile. Alternate translation: “I myself will go to your breasts which are like two sweet\-smelling mountains” or “I myself will be close to your breasts, which are like two pleasant smelling hills”

**""Come} with me from Lebanon, {my} bride;"**

This entire verse is a metaphor. This is poetry and the author is not literally indicating that the woman is physically in the mountains and near wild and dangerous animals. Rather, the author is using this metaphor to express the man’s feelings regarding being physically distant from the woman and his strong desire to have the woman near him and away from anything that could harm her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly using a simile as modeled by the UST.

## Song of Solomon 4:9 (#2) (id: 279001)

**"You have enchanted my heart,"** \- **"you have enchanted my heart"**

The phrase translated as **you have enchanted my heart** is an idiom which could mean: (1\) to steal or capture a person’s heart. In Jewish thinking the **heart** was the center of a persons thinking. To capture a person’s **heart** probably also had the added meaning of causing them to be so in love that they could not think clearly because they were so overcome with feelings of love. Alternate translation: “You have captured my heart … you have captured my heart” or “It is as though you have captured my heart … it is as though you have captured my heart” or “You have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind … you have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind“ (2\) the the woman had made the man’s **heart** beat faster. Alternate translation: “You have caused my heart to beat fast … you have caused my heart to beat fast” (3\) that the woman had encouraged the man’s **heart**. Alternate translation: “You have encouraged my heart … you have encouraged my heart” or “You have given me heart … you have given me heart”

**"my sister"**

The man and woman are not actually brother and sister. The phrase **my sister** is a term of endearment which expresses affection between lovers. This phrase indicates that the man and woman have a close companionship and deep emotional bond. If calling a lover **my sister** would be offensive or socially inappropriate in your culture you could use a different term of endearment or indicate the meaning of **my sister** with a footnote. Alternately, you could indicate the meaning explicitly as modeled by the UST.

Here, the woman continues the “garden” metaphor (that the man began in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12)) by referring to her body as **my garden** and then **his garden**. In this verse the woman calls to the wind to blow on her **garden** so that **its spices flow** into the air and attract the man she loves. The woman then offers her body to the man she loves by inviting him to **come to his garden** (a poetic way of inviting him to come to her and enjoy her body). You should translate the term **garden** here the same way you did in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12) because both uses refer to the woman’s body. In [4:13](https://ref.ly/Song4:13) the man spoke of the woman’s body as “an orchard of pomegranate trees with delicious fruits” and here the woman invites the man to **come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit**.

As the author has done throughout this book so far, he continues to use metaphors to describe feelings and events that are common to romantic relationships. (See: Metaphor)

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Order of events

5:2–8 seems to describe events that would have chronologically and logically occurred before the events described in 3:6–5:1\. The solution to this seeming problem is to understand that this book is poetry and that the author is poetically describing emotions and feelings that occur between a man and woman who romantically love each other. Because the author is using poetry to describe the couple’s romantic relationship and its associated feelings, he does not need to follow the conventions of chronological story telling.

### Whether 5:2–8 describes events that really happened or that happened in a dream.

There are two main views among Bible scholars regarding the events described in 5:2–8\. One view is that the events which 5:2–8 describe happened in a dream. The other view is that the events that 5:2–8 describe happened after the man awakened the women from sleeping or from being nearly asleep. The vast majority of Bible scholars think that the first view is correct, that the events described in 5:2–8 happened in a dream.

### The “sister” metaphor

The phrase **my sister** is used in 4:9; 4:10, 4:12, 5:1, and 5:2\. The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase in 5:1, and 5:2 the same way as you translated it in 4:9; 4:10, and 4:12 because the author uses it with the same meaning in this chapter. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in 4:9 for more information regarding this phrase.

### An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “towers of” in [5:13](https://ref.ly/Song5:13)

In verse 13, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “towers of.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “yielding.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “yielding” is used in place of “towers of” then, the first portion of 5:13 in the ULT would read “His cheeks {are} like a bed of spices, yielding herbal spices” (and The UST would read “His cheeks are like a garden where spices grow that produce sweet\-smelling perfume”). The phrase “yielding herbal spices” would then be further describing the phrase “a bed of spices.” The point of the comparison would be that the man’s cheeks smell like a garden bed of spices which yields herbal spices. If you choose to use the word “yielding” in your translation you could explain the basis of the comparison for your readers in your translation if you think it would help them. Alternate translation: “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that produce herbal spices” or “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that yield herbal spices”

## Song of Solomon 5:1 (#1) (id: 279032)

**""I have come to my garden, my sister, {my} bride;"**

Here, the man continues using the “garden” metaphor that he began in [4:12](https://ref.ly/Song4:12) and again refers to the woman’s body as a **garden**. Here the man accepts the woman’s invitation (that she gave in the previous verse) to enjoy her body. The lines **I have plucked my myrrh with my spice** and **I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey** and **I have drunk my wine with my milk** are all metaphors for the man enjoying the woman’s body. If you used similes to translate [4:12–16](https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song4:16) you should continue to do so here. Alternate translation: “You who are as dear to me as a sister, my bride, I am ready to go with you and enjoy the delights of your body, it will be as though I will be gathering myrrh with my other spices, and eating my honey and honeycomb, and drinking my wine and my milk”

**""Eat, friends;"**

The author does not say who is speaking to the couple here so you should not indicate the speakers explicitly in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, as the UST does, the speakers could be: (1\) the “daughters of Jerusalem” who spoke earlier in the book. The daughters of Jerusalem are speaking to the couple at the couple’s wedding. If you are using section headers you can use a phrase such as “The young women of Jerusalem speaking to the couple” or “The young women of Jerusalem speak to the couple at their wedding” (2\) a group of people who are the couple’s friends and wedding guests. If you are using section headers you can use a phrase such as “The couple’s friends speak ” or “The couple’s wedding guests speak”

## Song of Solomon 5:1 (#7) (id: 279038)

**""Eat, friends;"**

Eating and drinking are metaphors which are used to represent the newly married couple enjoying their sexual union. The phrase **be drunk** is an encouragement to fully enjoy the delights of their sexual union. If it would help your readers you could express the meaning with a simile. Alternately, you could express the meaning in plain language by adding a describing phrase such as “with love.” If this metaphor of becoming drunk might be offensive to your your hearers you could use a phrase such as “drink deeply” or “drink abundantly” instead of “be drunk.” Alternate translation: “Enjoy your marital intimacy and make love until you are fully satisfied as if you are eating food until full and drinking wine freely” or “Eat, friends; Drink, and be drunk with love” or “Eat, friends; Drink, and drink abundantly of love”

Here, the term **heart** could represent: (1\) the woman’s thoughts and mental awareness which would make the phrase **my heart is awake** mean that her mind is alert and dreaming after she had started to sleep. Alternate translation: “I am asleep, but my mind is dreaming” or “I am asleep, but my mind is alert and dreaming” (2\) the woman’s entire person which would make the phrase **my heart is awake** mean that she had been awakened after falling **asleep** or awakened after she was almost **asleep**. Alternate translation: “I was almost asleep, now I am awakened” or “I was asleep, but now I have been awakened”

**""and my hands dripped {with} myrrh"**

The phrase **my hands dripped with myrrh** and the phrase **my fingers dripped with flowing myrrh** mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

The phrase **bathing in milk** explains what color the **doves** (eyes) are. The two phrases, **beside stream beds of water** and **sitting by the pools**, both describe the **doves** as being by water.

## Song of Solomon 5:12 (#2) (id: 279080)

**""His eyes {are} like doves beside stream beds of water,"**

The phrases **beside stream beds of water** and **sitting by the pools** mean basically the same thing. They both describe the **doves** as being by water. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “His eyes are like doves beside stream beds of water, bathing in milk” or “His eyes are like doves bathing in milk, sitting by the pools”

**""His cheeks {are} like a bed of spices,"**

Here, the man’s **cheeks** are compared to two things; a garden, or an area in a garden, used for planting **spices** and **towers of herbal spices**.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices and like towers that contain herbal spices”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His lips are beautiful, fragrant, and soft.

**"His arms {are} rods of gold mounted with topaz"**

Here, the woman compares the man’s **arms** to **rods of gold mounted with topaz**. The woman uses this comparison because **rods of gold** were powerful, had an attractive color, and had a finely rounded shape and **topaz** would have made the **rods of gold** even more nice to look at.

**"his appearance {is} like Lebanon, {as} choice as the cedars"**

**Lebanon** was a beautiful mountainous region and the cedar trees that grew there were tall and strong and considered to be the best wood. The word **choice** here means “excellent quality” so the phrase **as choice as the cedars** means that the man is of excellent quality like the **cedars** in **Lebanon**. The point of this comparison is that the man is majestic like the mountainous, wooded area of **Lebanon** and is tall and strong and stately like the **cedars**. Also, similar to how the **cedars** are better than other trees so he is outstanding in comparison to other men. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain the point of this comparison or express this meaning in plain language.

Song of Songs 6 General Notes
=============================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Beauty

In 6:4–10 the man describes the woman he loves as the epitome of female beauty and attractiveness by using various similes.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### Metaphors

In the ancient Near East, it was acceptable to describe a woman using similes involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different similes of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: Simile)

### The meaning of 6:12

6:12 is very difficult to understand and its meaning is uncertain. Bible scholars have a variety of different opinions on the exact meaning of this verse because it is a very difficult verse to interpret and therefore there are a variety of different opinions on how the words and phrases relate to each other and what the exact meaning of some of the words are in context. Published versions of the Bible differ significantly from one another in their rendering of this verse. The ULT seeks to offer a reasonable translation of this verse. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in the way that it translates this verse. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the reading of ULT.

### The meaning of the phrase “like the dance of two armies” in 6:13

The meaning of the phrase “like the dance of two armies” is uncertain and Bible scholars have different opinions on the exact meaning of this verse. The ULT offers one possible translation of this verse. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in the way that it translates this verse. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the reading of ULT.

## Song of Solomon 6:1 (#1) (id: 279102)

**""Where did he go, your beloved,"**

The question **Where did he go, your beloved** and the question **Where did he turn, your beloved** have basically the same meaning. This type of repetition is a common feature of Hebrew poetry. This question is asked twice, in slightly different ways, for emphasis and poetic effect. It would be good to retain this repetition if possible but if saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “Where did he go, your beloved, most beautiful woman among women? Let us seek him with you” or “Most beautiful woman among women, where did he turn your beloved? Let us seek him with you”

**""My beloved went down to his garden,"**

The woman resumes the “garden” metaphor that was used in [4:12–5:1](https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1) by again referring to her body as a **garden**. The phrase **graze in the gardens** and **glean lilies** are both metaphors for the man enjoying the woman’s body. If you used similes to translate [4:12–5:1](https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1) you should continue to use similes here. Alternate translation: “My beloved went to me. I am like a garden where beds of spices grow. He came to me in order to enjoy my body like a gazelle enjoys grazing in gardens and like a person enjoys gleaning lilies”

The man is using the numbers, **Sixty** and **eighty** as a poetic way to make a comprehensive statement.

If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis in a way that would be natural in your language.

**"one {is} she to her mother"**

The phrase **one is she to her mother** could mean: (1\) that the woman the man loves is special **to her mother** (with **one** being used in contrast to the large numbers of other women described in the previous verse). Alternate translation: “she is special to her mother” or “her mother thinks she is special” or “her mother thinks she is unique” (2\) that the woman was the only child or the only daughter that her mother had. Alternate translation: “she is the only child of her mother” or “her mother’s only daughter” or “she is the only child of her mother”

## Song of Solomon 6:9 (#5) (id: 279133)

**""one {is} she to her mother;"**

If you decided that **one** means “special” here and that **pure** means “favorite” then these two lines are parallel and mean basically the same thing because both these words then have similar meanings and the phrases **her mother** and **the woman who bore her** both mean the same thing. The second line is emphasizing the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words which is common in Hebrew poetry. It would be good to show this repetition to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these two lines into one. Alternate translation: “her mother thinks that she is very special” or “she is very special to her mother”

**""Who {is} that, the woman who looks down like {the} dawn,"**

The author does not say who is speaking here so you should not indicate explicitly who is speaking in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking the speaker or speakers could be: (1\) the man speaking to the woman he loves. If you are using section headers you can follow the example of the UST and include this verse under the section heading for 6:4–10 that indicates the man is speaking. (2\) the **daughters** and the **queens** and **concubines** mentioned in the previous verse. If you are using section headers you can use a phrase for the section header such as “The daughters, the queens, and the concubines praise the woman” or “The other women praise the woman” or something comparable.

It is difficult to know with certainty who is speaking in these two verses and because of this Bible scholars have different opinions about who is speaking here. Because the author does not say who is speaking you should not indicate who is speaking in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking the speaker could be: (1\) the man in both verses. If you decide the man is speaking in both these verses you can follow the example of the UST and include theses two verses under the section heading for 6:4–11 that indicates the man is speaking.

Song of Songs 7 General Notes
=============================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Beauty

In 7:1–7 the man describes the woman as the epitome of female beauty and attractiveness using various similes and metaphors.

Important figures of speech in this chapter
-------------------------------------------

### Similes and metaphors

There are many similes and metaphors in this chapter. Their purpose is to describe the beauty of the woman and to describe romantic love between a man and a woman. (See: Simile) and (See:Metaphor)

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “love” in [7:6](https://ref.ly/Song7:6)

In verse 6, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “love.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “one who is loved.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “one who is loved” is used instead of “love” then, the portion of 7:6 that the ULT translates as “love with delights!” would instead be translated “one who is loved, with all your delights!”

### An alternate translation possibility for the words that the ULT translates as “the lips of those who sleep” in [7:9](https://ref.ly/Song7:9)

In verse 9, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “the lips of those who sleep.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “lips and teeth.” The translators of the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) thought this and translated this phrase as “my lips and my teeth.” If a Bible translation exists in your region that translates this phrase with the word “teeth” instead of “those who sleep” consider using “lips and teeth” instead of “the lips of those who sleep” in your translation.

**""How your feet are beautiful in sandals, daughter of a noble!"**

If you are using section headings to indicate who is speaking and you decided in the previous verse that the woman said the words “Why do you look at the Shulammite like the dance of two armies” you will need to place a section header above this verse indicating that the man is now speaking. The man begins speaking directly to the woman in this verse and continues speaking to her until part way through [7:9](https://ref.ly/Song7:9).

The point of this comparison is that the woman’s **navel** is nicely rounded like a **rounded** wine **bowl**. The phrase **that never lacks spiced wine** describes what is inside the bowl and probably means that in a similar way to how **spiced wine** excites the man and gives him joy so her **navel** excites him and gives him joy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a simile to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “Your navel is beautifully rounded and causes me to feel excited” or “Your navel is beautifully rounded like a round wine bowl and it causes me to feel excited like drinking spiced wine” or “Your navel is beautifully rounded like a bowl and gives me joy and excitement like when I drink spiced wine”

**""Your belly {is} a heap of wheat"**

The man is speaking of the woman’s **belly** as if it were **a heap of wheat**. The point of comparing the woman’s **belly** to **a heap of wheat** is that **wheat** was a very common food in Israel and so was considered nourishing and satisfying to the appetite. The man is expressing that the woman satisfies him. The man is also comparing the color of her **belly** to **wheat** since harvested **wheat** is a pleasant golden beige or tan color. He is also comparing the pleasant shape of her **belly** to the pleasant shape of a **heap of wheat**. The phrase **encircled with the lilies** describes what is around the **heap of wheat** and probably means that in a similar way to how **a heap of wheat encircled with the lilies** looks beautiful so her **belly** is beautiful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a simile to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “Your belly is as beautiful as a heap of wheat that is encircled with lilies and it satisfies me” or “The shape and color of your belly is beautiful” or “Your belly is beautiful and satisfying”

The appearance of a **tower** decorated with **ivory** would be beautiful in appearance and tall and slender. By comparing the woman’s **neck** to a **tower of ivory** the man is saying that the woman’s **neck** is both beautiful and tall and slender. Your language may have a comparable expression for complementing a woman’s neck in this way that you could use in your translation or you could state the basis of the comparison. Alternately, if it would help your readers, you could state the meaning plainly.

The point of comparison may be that the woman’s eyes sparkle or shine in the light like when light shines on water or it may be that her eyes look mysterious and deep (and possibly dark) like a deep pool of water or it may be that her eyes reflect light like a pool of water does. Your language may have a comparable expression for complementing a woman’s eyes that you could use in your translation or you could state one or more of these points of comparison or if you have been translating metaphors with similes you could use a simile here.

This tower was high and was used as a military watch tower to look out for enemy attacks. The point of comparison is that the woman’s nose was high and/or long (which was considered attractive in that culture) and beautiful and made her look dignified and impressive like **the tower of Lebanon**. Your language may have a comparable expression for complementing a woman’s nose that you could use in your translation or you could state the meaning plainly.

**""Going down for my beloved smoothly,"**

Some Bible scholars think the speaker in this part of the verse: (1\) is the woman. Because the author does not say who is speaking here you should not indicate the speaker explicitly in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, as the UST does, you can indicate that the woman is now speaking. (2\) continues to be the man. If you decide that the man is still speaking you do not need a header above this portion, but if you are using headers, you will need a header above the next verse indicating that the woman is speaking (since Bible scholars agree that the speaker is the woman beginning in 7:10 and continuing through at least 8:3\).

## Song of Solomon - Chapter 8 Introduction (id: 718700)

Song of Songs 8 General Notes
=============================

Special concepts in this chapter
--------------------------------

### Strong feelings of love and commitment between a man and woman who love each other romantically

8:6–7 describe the strong feelings of love, commitment, and emotional attachment that can exist between a man and woman who love each other romantically.

Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
-------------------------------------------------------

### The meaning of [8:12](https://ref.ly/Song8:12)

The three possible meanings of [8:12](https://ref.ly/Song8:12) are: (1\) that the woman is speaking of herself as a vineyard and saying that her vineyard is hers alone and is comparing herself to Solomon’s vineyard (which was discussed in [8:11](https://ref.ly/Song8:11)) and saying that Solomon can keep the profits from his vineyard and his vineyard keepers can keep their portion of the profits from that vineyard. This is the interpretation of the UST. (2\) that the woman is speaking of herself as a vineyard and saying that her vineyard is hers alone but that the man who she loves and calls Solomon can freely have the vineyard (her) because she chooses to give herself freely to him. (3\) that the man is speaking of the woman he loves as a vineyard and saying that his vineyard (the woman he loves) is his alone and is comparing his vineyard (the woman he loves) to Solomon’s vineyard (which was discussed in [8:11](https://ref.ly/Song8:11)) and saying that he feels more wealthy than Solomon because he has the woman he loves as his vineyard and so Solomon can keep the profits from his vineyard and his Solomon’s keepers can keep their portion of the profits from that vineyard.

## Song of Solomon 8:1 (#1) (id: 279221)

**""Who will give you like a brother to me,"**

Here, the woman is using the idiom **Who will give you** to express her wish that the man she loves be **like a brother** to her (so that she could publicly **kiss** him). If it would help your readers, you could an equivalent idiom from your language that expresses a desire or a wish or you could state the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “How I wish that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at the breasts of my mother” or “How I desire that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at the breasts of my mother”

**""Who will give you like a brother to me,"**

In the culture at the time the author wrote this poem it was not socially acceptable for someone to show public affection towards someone they were married to and/or loved romantically but it was acceptable for siblings to give each other non romantic kisses of affection in public (the word **outside** means “in public” here). If it would help your readers you could tell your readers in a footnote that the woman desires that the man she loves be **like a brother** to her so that she could show public affection toward him.

**""Who will give you like a brother to me,"**

The phrase **who nursed at the breasts of my mother** describes the word **brother** and has a similar meaning as the term **brother**. Saying the same thing in slightly different ways is a common feature of Hebrew poetry. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one.

The author does not say who is speaking here so you should not indicate who you think is speaking explicitly in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, the majority of Bible scholars think that the woman’s brothers are speaking here. Because of this and because the phrases **A sister belongs to us** and **What will we do with our sister** in 8:8 seem to indicate that the woman’s brothers are speaking, the most likely view is that her brothers are the the ones speaking so if you choose to use headers you can place a header above 8:8–9, indicating that the woman’s brothers are speaking as modeled by the UST.

**""There} was a vineyard for Solomon in Baal Hamon."**

Because the author does not say who is speaking you should not indicate who is speaking in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking the speaker could be: (1\) the woman in both 8:11 and 8:12\. If you decide that the woman is speaking in these verses you can follow the example of the UST and include these two verses under the section heading for 8:10 that indicates the woman is speaking. (2\) the man in both these verses. If you decide the man is speaking in these verses you can put a section header at the top of 8:11 indicating that the man is speaking.

## Revelation 1:1 (#1) (id: 260564)

**"The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **revelation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “The things that God revealed to Jesus Christ” or “The things that Jesus Christ revealed, which God gave him”

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: `33391@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:2 (#1) (id: 260570)

**"who attested"**

Although John uses the past tense and says **testified**, he means that he is testifying to what **he saw** by sending this written record of his visions to the believers in the seven churches. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “who is testifying, by sending you this written record of his visions,”

## Revelation 1:2 (#2) (id: 260571)

**"the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ"**

These two phrases mean similar things. John is using them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “to what God told Jesus Christ to disclose”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:2 (#3) (id: 260572)

**"the word of God"**

Here, John uses **word** figuratively to refer to the message that God spoke by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the message that God spoke”

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:3 (#1) (id: 260574)

**"the one reading"**

In this context, the word **reading** implicitly means “reading aloud.” In John's culture, a message to a church, such as the one he is sending to the seven churches in this book, would have been read aloud to the assembled believers. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. (Revelation is not simply declaring a blessing upon any believer today who would read the book out loud in private.) Alternate translation: “the one reading aloud” or “the one reading for others to hear”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:3 (#2) (id: 260575)

**"the one reading"**

Here, **the one reading** does not refer to a specific person. It refers to anyone who reads the words of the prophecy aloud. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “anyone who reads aloud”

See: Generic Noun Phrases

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Generic Noun Phrases (ID: `33277@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:3 (#3) (id: 260576)

**"keeping"**

See the discussion of the term “keep” in the General Introduction to Revelation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly here and elsewhere throughout the book. Alternate translation: “obeying”

See: Idiom

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:3 (#4) (id: 260577)

**"the things having been written in it"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the things that I have written in it”

See: Active or Passive

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Active or Passive (ID: `33258@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:3 (#5) (id: 260578)

**"for the time"**

Here, **the time** refers specifically to the appointed time when God will make the prophecies in this book come true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the time for the fulfillment of what is written in this book”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#1) (id: 260579)

**"John"**

In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “From John” or (with no comma following) “I, John, am writing this letter”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#2) (id: 260580)

**"to the seven churches in Asia"**

In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you who are members of the seven churches in Asia”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: `33256@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#3) (id: 260581)

**"Grace to you and peace from the one being and the one having been and the one coming and from the seven spirits who {are} before his throne"**

In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Use a form in your language that makes it clear that this is a greeting and blessing. Alternate translation: “May the one who is and who was and who is coming and the seven spirits who are before his throne give you grace and peace”

See: Blessings

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Blessings (ID: `33371@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#4) (id: 260582)

**"Grace to you and peace from the one being and the one having been and the one coming and from the seven spirits who {are} before his throne"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **grace** and **peace**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “May the one who is and who was and who is coming and the seven spirits who are before his throne treat you kindly and make you peaceful”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#5) (id: 260583)

**"to you"**

The word **you** is plural here because it refers to all of the believers to whom John is writing. So use the plural form here in your translation if your language marks that distinction, and use the singular or plural form in the rest of the book as the context indicates. (As the General Introduction to Revelation explains, these notes will generally only identify forms as singular or plural if that might not be clear from the context.)

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: `33321@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#6) (id: 260584)

**"the one being and the one having been and the one coming"**

These three phrases do not describe three different people. They all refer to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who is and who was and who is coming”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#7) (id: 260585)

**"the seven spirits"**

Here, the **seven spirits** could refer to: (1\) the Spirit of God, that is, the Holy Spirit. The Bible can use the number **seven** as a symbol for completeness and perfection, for example, it describes the Holy Spirit with seven attributes in [11:2](https://ref.ly/Isa11:2). If this phrase refers to the Holy Spirit, then John is giving a Trinitarian benediction by mentioning God the Father and the Holy Spirit in this verse and Jesus Christ in the next verse. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit” (2\) seven individual spirits who serve God. Alternate translation: “the seven spirit beings” or “the seven angelic spirits”

See: Symbolic Language

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Symbolic Language (ID: `33427@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:4 (#8) (id: 260586)

**"who {are} before his throne"**

If these are individual **spirits**, is not entirely clear who they are, but they would be seven individual spiritual beings who had important responsibilities serving God. John indicates this by association by noting that they are **before his throne**, that is, in God's presence and ready to serve him whenever needed. Some interpreters believe that they may be the “seven angels” whom John describes in [8:2](https://ref.ly/Rev8:2). Alternate translation: “who are always ready to serve him in important ways”

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#1) (id: 260587)

**"and from Jesus Christ"**

The first half of this verse continues the sentence from the previous verse. It may be helpful to indicate this by repeating some of the information from the previous verse. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “And may grace and peace also be to you from Jesus Christ”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#2) (id: 260588)

**"the faithful witness,” “the firstborn” from the dead and “the ruler of the kings of the earth"**

In this verse, John is alluding several times to Psalm 89\. In that psalm, God speaks of King David as his “firstborn” and says that he will make him “the most exalted of the kings of the earth.” God also says that he will establish David’s throne forever like the moon, “the faithful witness” in the sky. Psalm 89 as a whole is a meditation on the promises that God gave to David in [2 Samuel 7](https://ref.ly/2Sam0:0). So all of these allusions indicate that Jesus Christ is the one who fulfills God’s promises to David. You may want to explain this in a footnote. You may also want to mark the phrases that are Old Testament allusions by putting them in quotation marks, as the ULT does.

See: Quote Markings

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Quote Markings (ID: `33306@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#3) (id: 260589)

**"the firstborn” from the dead"**

John is speaking as if Jesus was literally “born” when he became alive again after he died. Since Jesus was the first person to do this, John says that he is the **firstborn**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the first person to become alive again after dying”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#4) (id: 260590)

**"from the dead"**

John is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among people who have died”

See: Nominal Adjectives

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: `33294@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#5) (id: 260591)

**""**

A new sentence begins here that continues through the rest of the next verse. This sentence praises Jesus. To make this clear for your readers, you could create a verse bridge for verses 5–6 and begin with John’s wish that would Jesus receive glory and power. A verse bridge might say something like this: “May the glory and the power forever be to Jesus because he is the one who loves us and who has released us from our sins by his blood and who has made us a kingdom, priests for his God and Father. Amen.”

See: Verse Bridges

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Verse Bridges (ID: `33410@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#6) (id: 260592)

**"To the one loving us"**

Here, **the one** refers to Jesus Christ. If this is not clear to your readers, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “To Jesus Christ, who loves us”

* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#7) (id: 260593)

**"us"** \- **"us"** \- **"our"**

By **us** and **our**, John means both himself and his readers. So use the inclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Exclusive and Inclusive ‘We’ (ID: `33271@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#8) (id: 260594)

**"having released us from our sins"**

John is speaking of **sins** as if they were something that had held him and his readers captive and from which they needed to be **released**. He means that Jesus obtained forgiveness from God for people’s sins. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one having obtained forgiveness for us for our sins”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:5 (#9) (id: 260595)

**"by his blood"**

John is using the word **blood** to refer by association to the sacrificial death of Jesus, since Jesus shed his blood when he died for **our sins**. Alternate translation: “by his sacrificial death”

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#1) (id: 260596)

**"he has made"** \- **"his"** \- **"to him"**

The pronouns **he**, **his**, and **him** all refer to Jesus. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Jesus has made … his … to Jesus”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#2) (id: 260597)

**"a kingdom, priests to God and his Father"**

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of a **kingdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. The phrase **a kingdom, priests to God** is an allusion to [Exodus 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6), where God tells the Israelites, “You will be to me a kingdom of priests.” This means that the Israelites will have the God as their king and that they will lead the other people of the world to worship God. Alternate translation: “people who obey God, the Father of Jesus Christ, as their king and who lead others to worship him”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#3) (id: 260598)

**"to God and his Father"**

This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The phrase **his Father** tells who **God** is. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “to God, who is his Father”

See: Hendiadys

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Hendiadys (ID: `33280@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#4) (id: 260599)

**"Father"**

**Father** is an important title that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. Be sure to retain this title in your translation.

* **Associated Articles:** Translating Son and Father (ID: `33349@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#5) (id: 260600)

**"to him {be} the glory and the power"**

If your language does not use abstract nouns for **glory** or **power**, you could express these ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “may all of creation acknowledge how glorious and powerful he is”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#6) (id: 260601)

**"to the ages"**

This expression refers to endless future time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “forever”

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:6
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:6 (#7) (id: 260602)

**"Amen"**

## Revelation 1:7 (#1) (id: 260603)

**""Behold, he is coming with the clouds,”"**

**Behold, he is coming with the clouds** is a quotation from [7:13](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13). The phrases **every eye will see him, even those who pierced him** and **will mourn because of him** are quotations from [12:10](https://ref.ly/Zech12:10). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off these Old Testament quotations with quotation marks, as the ULT does, or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

See: Quote Markings

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Quote Markings (ID: `33306@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:7 (#2) (id: 260604)

**"Behold"**

As the General Introduction to Revelation discusses, here John is using the term **Behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation, in this instance and throughout the book. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully!”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:7 (#3) (id: 260605)

**"he is coming with the clouds"**

The pronoun **he** here refers to Jesus Christ. If this is unclear to your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus is coming with the clouds”

See: Pronouns — When to Use Them

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Pronouns — When to Use Them (ID: `33424@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:7 (#4) (id: 260606)

**"he is coming with the clouds"**

John is referring to Jesus returning from heaven through the sky by association with the **clouds** that are in the sky. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will return visibly in the sky”

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: `33293@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:7 (#5) (id: 260607)

**"every eye will see him"**

John is using one part of a person, the **eye**, to mean all of a person in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “every person will see him”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:7 (#6) (id: 260608)

**"those who pierced him"**

John is using one thing that people did to Jesus when they killed him, they **pierced** him, to mean all that they did when they killed him. (Jesus’ hands and feet were pierced with nails when he was hung on the cross, and later a soldier pierced his side with a spear to see whether he was dead.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who killed him”

See: Synecdoche

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:7
* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: `33315@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:7 (#7) (id: 260609)

**"Yes, Amen"**

The terms **Yes** and **Amen** mean similar things. John is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “It will certainly be so!”

## Revelation 1:8 (#1) (id: 260610)

**"I am the alpha and the omega,” says the Lord God, “the one being and the one having been and the one coming, the Ruler of All"**

Here, **says the Lord God** indicates that the clauses that come before and after this phrase are quotations. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move this phrase to the beginning or end of the verse. Alternate translation: “The Lord God says, ‘I am the alpha and the omega, the one being and the one having been and the one coming, the Ruler of All’”

## Revelation 1:8 (#2) (id: 260611)

**"the alpha and the omega,” says the Lord"**

Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End” after this statement. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the reading of the ULT and not include the extra phrase.

* **Associated Articles:** Textual Variants (ID: `33405@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:8 (#3) (id: 260612)

**"the alpha and the omega"**

The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are **alpha** and **omega**. When God says that he is these letters, he means that he is the one who was at the beginning of all things and who will be at the end of all things. If you wish to retain this image in your translation, you could use the first and last letters of your own alphabet. Alternatively, you could use plain language. See the next two notes for further possibilities. Alternate translation: “the A and the Z” or “the one who was at the beginning of all things and who will be at the end of all things”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: `33292@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:8 (#4) (id: 260613)

**"the alpha and the omega"**

The implication of God having been at the beginning of all things may be that God created all things, and the implication of that fact that God will be at the end of all things may be that God will bring all things to their appropriate end. In other words, God may be asserting his identity as the creator of the world and the ultimate judge of the world. Alternate translation: “the creator and the ultimate judge of the world”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 1:8 (#5) (id: 260614)

**"the alpha and the omega"**

God may also be using the first and last letters of the alphabet to represent two extremes of time, the beginning and end of time, in order to mean those extremes and all of the time in between. In that case, this expression would be equivalent to what God says in the rest of the quotation in this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the one who has always existed”

**"brother"**

John is using the term **brother** to indicate that he has the same faith as the people to whom he is writing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fellow believer”

**"the angels of the seven churches"**

In chapters 2 and 3, Jesus will dictate a letter to each of the **angels of the seven churches** as if those angels were the churches themselves. So in this vision in chapter 1, these **angels**, symbolized by the **stars** in Jesus’ **right hand**, seem to personify the churches. That is, the angels represent the churches as if the churches were people. These **angels** could be: (1\) actual angels, that is, spiritual beings. Alternate translation: “angels who represent the seven churches” (2\) leaders of the churches, whom Jesus is describing as angels. Alternate translation: “leaders of the seven churches” (3\) messengers bringing news of the churches to John and carrying John’s letters back to the churches.

See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of how Jesus is using the second\-person singular to address the “angel” of this church.

Jesus is not speaking of a literal **lampstand** here; when he says that he will remove this lampstand, he means that the assembly of believers in Ephesus will no longer exist. However, since Jesus refers to the lampstands in John’s vision at the opening of this letter, it would be good to show the connection between the reference there and the reference here. In your translation, you might translate the term **lampstand** directly here but then explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “I will remove your lampstand from its place, yes, you will no longer be a church”

**"Let the one having an ear hear"**

Through this expression, Jesus is addressing his audience in the third person, even though he is speaking directly to them.

**"To the one conquering"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Jesus is speaking as if the person to whom he is making this promise will win a victory. He is actually referring to a person who refuses to worship idols even at the risk of persecution and death. In your translation, you may wish to express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “To the one who refuses to worship idols even at the risk of persecution and death”

## Revelation 2:7 (#7) (id: 260682)

**"the tree of life"**

Jesus is using this possessive form to identify this **tree** not as having life but as giving **life**. In other words, Jesus means not a living tree but a life\-giving tree. Alternate translation: “the life\-giving tree”

## Revelation 2:7 (#8) (id: 260683)

**"the tree of life"**

This is a reference to the description in [Genesis 2:9](https://ref.ly/Gen2:9) of the **tree of life** that was in the Garden of Eden. The fruit of that tree enabled anyone who ate it to live forever. So Jesus is saying by implication that he will give everlasting life to anyone who remains faithful to him. However, since the tree of life appears in the closing vision of the book, in [22:2](https://ref.ly/Rev22:2), it would be good to retain the image here rather than simply express its meaning in plain language. So you might translate the phrase **tree of life** directly but then explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “I will grant to him to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God, yes, I will grant him everlasting life”

**"you are rich"**

Jesus is speaking as if the believers in Smyrna were literally **rich**, even though he has just acknowledged their **poverty**. He means that they are spiritually rich because God will reward them for their faithfulness and suffering. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God will reward you richly”

**"but they are not"**

Jesus is speaking as if the people who are slandering the believers in Smyrna are literally **not** Jews. He means that they are acting as if they were not Jews, since they are persecuting people who sincerely worship the God of Israel. This makes them **not** Jews in some spiritual sense. Alternate translation: “but who are not acting in the way that Jews should”

**"are} a synagogue of Satan"**

Jesus is speaking as if the **synagogue** where these Jews gathered was literally devoted to the worship of **Satan** instead of the God of Israel. He means that when these Jews gather together and **slander** genuine believers, they are serving Satan’s purposes rather than God’s. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that plainly. Alternate translation: “their gatherings really serve Satan’s purposes rather than God’s”

## Revelation 2:10 (#1) (id: 260690)

**"to throw {some} of you into prison"**

Jesus does not mean that the devil will literally **throw** some of the believers in Smyrna **into prison**. That is, the devil will not pick them up and heave them through the air. Alternate translation: “to have some of you put in prison”

**"to throw {some} of you into prison"**

Jesus is speaking of **the devil** as the person who will do this action, but Jesus is using the devil to represent everyone who will responsible for it. The Jews in Smyrna would actually have the believers put in prison, acting under the devil’s influence. Alternate translation: “to influence people to put some of you in prison”

## Revelation 2:10 (#4) (id: 260693)

**"so that you will be tested"**

The words **so that** introduce the purpose for which **the devil** will **throw** some of the believers **into prison**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Be sure that it is clear to your readers that this is a purpose that the devil is pursuing. Jesus is not saying that he is going to use the devil to test the believers to see if they will remain faithful. Alternate translation: “to try to get you to abandon your faith”

## Revelation 2:10 (#5) (id: 260694)

**"you"** \- **"you will be tested,"** \- **"you will have"**

The word **you** is plural in these instances. Jesus is speaking more directly to the believers in Smyrna to warn them about the suffering they are about to experience. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural forms of “you” and if you have been using the singular forms of “you” and “your” in these letters because they are addressed to individual angels, you may consider using the plural form of “you” here if that would be natural in your language.

## Revelation 2:10 (#6) (id: 260695)

**"for ten days"**

As the General Introduction to Revelation discusses, time references such as this one may have symbolic significance. In this case, by allusion to [1:14](https://ref.ly/Dan1:14), **ten days** may represent a short or limited amount of time for testing. However, as the Introduction explains, it would be appropriate to translate this as a literal period of time rather than offering an interpretation of the phrase such as “for a short time of testing.”

## Revelation 2:10 (#7) (id: 260696)

**"the crown of life"**

Jesus is speaking he will literally give these believers **life** as a crown to wear. He is using the word **crown** to mean “reward.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everlasting life as your reward”

## Revelation 2:11 (#3) (id: 260699)

**"certainly not"**

As the General Introduction to Revelation discusses, John frequently uses a double negative for emphasis that the ULT translates with the expression “certainly not,” as in this case. The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here and in the other instances of this double negative throughout the book.

## Revelation 2:11 (#5) (id: 260701)

**"will certainly not be hurt by the second death"**

Jesus is speaking as if people who had died would die a **second** time. By **the second death**, he means separation from God. That is spiritual death, just as physical death involves the separation of the human soul and spirit from the human body. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will certainly not experience separation from God after he dies physically”

Jesus is speaking as if **Satan** literally had a **throne** in the city of Pergamum. He means that Satan has great influence in that city.

Jesus is speaking as if he will literally **wage war** against the disobedient believers in Pergamum with the **sword** in his **mouth**. He likely means that he will announce a punishment against them that will become effective as soon as he speaks it. You could say that in your translation. The UST models one way to do that. However, since the symbol of the sword comes from the opening vision in the book, and since Jesus uses it to identify himself at the beginning of this letter, and since the symbol also appears in one of the last visions in the book, in [19:15–21](https://ref.ly/Rev19:15-Rev19:21), you may wish to retain the symbol in your translation rather than state the meaning plainly here.

**"no one knows except the one receiving it"**

If it would appear in your language that Jesus is contradicting himself by saying that **no one knows** the new name but then saying that **the one receiving it** knows this name, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only the person receiving it knows”

The word **Jezebel** is the name of a woman. It is not clear whether this is the actual name of this woman or whether Jesus is calling her by this name because she is like the wicked Queen Jezebel whose story is told in the Old Testament.

Alternate translation: “the children she has had with her adulterous lovers” (2\) the disciples of Jezebel. (However, since Jesus says in the previous verse that he will cause these disciples to experience tribulation if they do not repent, it appears that Jesus is giving them the opportunity to repent, so it seems unlikely that he would immediately pronounce a death sentence against them here.} Alternate translation: “her disciples”

## Revelation 3:7 (#1) (id: 260789)

**"The Holy One, the True One"**

Jesus is using the adjectives **Holy** and **True** as nouns to describe himself as a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases, as the ULT does by adding the word **One** in each case.

## Revelation 3:7 (#2) (id: 260790)

**"the one having the key of David"**

Jesus is not referring to a literal **key**. Rather, he is quoting from [Isaiah 22:22](https://ref.ly/Isa22:22), where God says that he will make a man named Eliakim the administrator of the royal palace in Jerusalem and give him the “key of the house of David,” symbolizing authority over the kingdom that the dynasty of David rules. As the Messiah, Jesus now has David’s royal authority. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one having royal authority as the Messiah”

## Revelation 3:7 (#3) (id: 260791)

**""the one opening and no one will shut"**

This is a continuation of the quotation and the image of the key from [Isaiah 22:22](https://ref.ly/Isa22:22). These two phrases say the same thing in opposite ways. God, speaking through Isaiah, was using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express, that he would give this new palace administrator authority that no one could defy. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases or express their meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who decides definitively whether to open a door or to lock it shut” or “whose authority no one can defy”

**"behold, I have put before you an opened door that no one is able to shut it"**

**"I have put before you an opened door"**

This **opened door** could symbolize: (1\) an opportunity to proclaim the gospel or (2\) entrance into everlasting life with Jesus. However, since the image of the **door** continues the image of the key from the previous verse, you may wish to retain the image by translating the phrase **I have put before you an opened door** directly.

It might seem that this sentence contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it by saying **behold** just once and by saying only **I will make** and not also **I will give**.

**"I have loved you"**

For emphasis, Jesus is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **have loved**.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 3:10
* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: `33283@UWTranslationManual`)

## Revelation 3:10 (#2) (id: 260807)

**"you have kept my word of endurance"**

Jesus is using this possessive form to describe a **word** or statement that commands **endurance**, not a statement characterized by endurance (that is, one that endures). Alternate translation: “you have obeyed my command to endure”

Jesus is speaking as if he would literally make a faithful and victorious believer a **pillar** in God’s temple. This likely symbolizes that the believer will always be in God’s temple, just as a pillar is a permanent fixture.

**"the beginning of the creation of God"**

Jesus is most likely using this possessive form to describe himself as the one who began the creation of God, that is, the one through whom God created all things. Jesus is likely using this phrase to mean the same thing as he does when he describes himself as “the alpha” or “the first.” Jesus is not saying that he was the first creature God created. Jesus is not a created being, he is the eternally begotten Son of God. Alternate translation: “the one through whom God created all things”

## Revelation 3:15 (#1) (id: 260821)

**"cold nor hot."** \- **"cold or hot"**

Jesus is speaking as if the believers in Laodicea were literally water that was a certain temperature. He is using the word **hot** to mean diligently obedient to God and the word **cold** to mean stubbornly resistant to God, so he means that the Laodiceans are complacent and indifferent. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “disobedient nor obedient … disobedient or obedient”

**"to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you might become rich"**

Jesus is speaking as if he wants the believers in Laodicea literally to buy **gold** from him. He is using gold to symbolize spiritual riches, meaning things such as a profound knowledge of God and a life transformed into the image of Christ. When Jesus says that this gold is **refined by fire**, he means that it is pure gold, that is, genuine wealth; by contrast, the riches that the Laodiceans have are not true riches.

As in [3:4](https://ref.ly/Rev3:4), white clothing symbolizes purity of life and devotion to Jesus. Accordingly, **nakedness** symbolizes a sinful life and indifference towards Jesus.

Jesus is speaking as if he wants the believers in Sardis literally to buy **salve** from him to **anoint** their **eyes**.

Jesus is speaking as if he were literally standing outside a **door** and seeking entrance to a house. He means that he is seeking to have personal fellowship with each of the Laodiceans to whom he is writing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

## Revelation 3:20 (#5) (id: 260840)

**"will eat with him, and he with me"**

Since people share table fellowship with others in their homes only if they have a close relationship, Jesus is using eating together to symbolize that he will become a good friend of the person who welcomes him. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I will eat with him and he will eat with me, as good friends do”

**"to sit with me on my throne"**

Jesus is speaking as if a victorious believer would literally **sit with** him on his **throne**. He means that the believer will share his ruling authority. He means the same thing when he says that he has **sat** with his **Father** on his **throne**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

**"the Spirit"**

Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [1:10](https://ref.ly/Rev1:10). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (See: Revelation [2:7](https://ref.ly/Rev2:11), [11](https://ref.ly/Rev2:11), [17](https://ref.ly/Rev2:17), [29](https://ref.ly/Rev2:29); [3:6](https://ref.ly/Rev3:6), [13](https://ref.ly/Rev3:13), [22](https://ref.ly/Rev3:22)).

## Revelation 5:8 (#3) (id: 260888)

**"which are the prayers of the saints"**

When John says that these **golden bowls** are the **prayers of the saints**, he likely means by association that the incense in the bowls represents the prayers, since prayers ascend to God in heaven similarly to the way that incense rises through the air and pleasantly attracts attention. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this by using a singular verb that would refer to the **incense** rather than a plural verb that would refer to the **bowls**.

**"of the saints"**

As the General Introduction to Revelation discusses, John often uses the term **saints** to describe people who believe in Jesus and obey him faithfully. John uses the term by association with the way these people are set apart as holy for God.

The living creatures and elders are speaking as if the Lamb literally **bought** people for God. They mean that through his sacrificial death, the Lamb saved them by setting them free from the guilt and power of sin.

## Revelation 5:11 (#2) (id: 260897)

**"myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands"**

John may be using these multiples of large numbers to indicate implicitly that the number of angels was too great to count. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “too great to count”

## Revelation 5:13 (#1) (id: 260901)

**"every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and everything in them"**

The phrase **everything in them** means basically the same thing as the phrase **every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea**. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first phrase by repeating the same idea with different words. John is describing his vision in a way reminiscent of Hebrew poetry, which was based on this kind of repetition. It would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, yes, everything in them”

John may mean that the rider on the white horse went out “as a conquering one,” that is, with all the capacity of a conqueror. In that case, for emphasis he would be using a construction in which a subject and its verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis.

## Revelation 6:5 (#1) (id: 260918)

**"a balance"**

The word **balance** describes an instrument for determining the weight of an object or comparing the weight of two objects. It consists of a central post with a crossbar from which two pans are hung. An object may be placed in one pan and known weights placed in the other pan until the crossbar remains level, meaning that both pans contain an equal weight. Or one object may be placed in one pan and a different object in the other pan; the pan that hangs lower contains the heavier object. Since John is describing what he saw, it would be appropriate to use the name or a description of the ancient tool rather than use the name of a modern device for weighing things. Alternate translation: “a balancing scale” or “a weighing instrument”

The implication is that there would be famine, so that **wheat** and **barley**, the staple crops in this culture, would become scarce and very expensive. (The balance that John describes the third rider holding in the previous verse may symbolize weighing grain for sale.) You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

The **denarius** was a silver coin that was worth a day’s wages for a laborer. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time.

The point of this comparison is that the sky went away, just as a scroll would roll away to the two sides of a surface if it split while someone had it spread out on that surface. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “the sky rolled away and disappeared, just as a scroll rolls up in two pieces if it splits”

In that case the two phrases would mean similar things, as the next two notes explain. John would be using the repetition for emphasis.

**"trumpets"** \- **"they might trumpet"**

John is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. The verb translated **trumpet** has the same root as the word translated **trumpets**. The repetition of the sounds may be intended to have a musical effect. You may be able to use the same construction in your translation if your language has similar words for this kind of instrument and for the action of playing it.

The word **Abaddon** is a Hebrew name that John spells out using Greek letters so that his readers will know how it sounds.

In your translation you can spell both names the way they sound in your language and then explain their meaning.

John speaks of the angel as if he were wearing **a cloud** as his clothing. This expression could be understood as figurative.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could introduce them in such a way as to indicate that John has not identified them previously. Alternate translation: “seven thunders spoke”

**"Seal what the seven thunders said and do not write it"**

The voice spoke as if John should literally **seal** what the thunders said. However, since the voice then specified that John was not to write anything down, the voice meant that John should keep secret what the thunders said.

See how you translated the word **sackcloth** in [6:12](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12). These **witnesses** wore sackcloth while prophesying in order to show their sorrow and grief over the sins that people were committing against God.

**"These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth"**

## Revelation 11:4 (#2) (id: 261129)

**"These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth"**

John assumes that his readers will understand that he is alluding to the vision had by the prophet Zechariah, who saw **two olive trees** and **two lampstands** in [Zechariah 4:2–6](https://ref.ly/Zech4:2-Zech4:6). In that vision, the trees and lampstands represented the governor, Zerubbabel, and the high priest, Joshua, who led the rebuilding of the temple despite opposition. In the same way, the two witnesses in John’s vision will faithfully call people to obey God despite opposition. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “These two witnesses will serve God faithfully despite opposition just as Zerubbabel and Joshua did, whom the prophet Zechariah saw depicted as two olive trees and two lampstands in a vision that God gave him”

## Revelation 11:5 (#3) (id: 261133)

**"devours their enemies"**

John is speaking as if **fire** literally **devours** or eats up anyone who would **wish to harm** these witnesses. He means that the fire destroys them completely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “destroys their enemies completely”

## Revelation 11:5 (#4) (id: 261134)

**"and if anyone should wish to harm them, he must be killed in this way"**

This clause is essentially a repetition of the first clause in the verse. John is speaking in something like Hebrew poetry, which was based on this kind of repetition. It would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if such repetition would not be natural in your language, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Yes, if anyone should wish to harm them, he must be killed in this way”

John is speaking as if these witnesses could literally **close up** the sky. As he goes on to say, he means that they will be able to prevent it from raining.

The point of these comparisons is that God once destroyed Jerusalem because its people were so wicked, like **Sodom**, and that Jerusalem oppressed people who belonged to God, like **Egypt**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly.

The terms **people**, **tribe**, **language**, and **nation** mean similar things. John is using the four terms together to make a comprehensive statement.

**"they might give to them"**

## Revelation 13:17 (#1) (id: 261296)

**"the number of its name"**

In this culture, people used the letters of the alphabet as symbols for numbers as well. As a result, it was possible to add up the values of the letters in someone’s name to get the **number** of that **name**. That is what John means implicitly here. If your readers would not be familiar with this practice, you could explain it in your translation. Alternate translation: “the sum of the numerical values of the letters in its name”

**"These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins"**

John is speaking as if the people who are singing have literally never had sexual relations. In context, he most likely means that they have not worshiped idols. Having sexual relations outside of marriage, or not waiting until marriage to have sexual relations, is a common Old Testament image for idol worship.

## Revelation 16:5 (#3) (id: 261410)

**"the one being and the one who was, the Holy One"**

Some ancient manuscripts read **the one being and the one who was, the Holy One**. ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “O Lord, the one being and the one who was and who is to be.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

**"I heard the altar saying"**

The phrase **sitting on many waters** is an allusion to [51:13](https://ref.ly/Jer51:13), where the same phrase describes the ancient city of Babylon and its location on the great Euphrates River. (The Hebrew word that Jeremiah uses can mean both “sit” and “dwell.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who lives next to a great river”

## Revelation 17:2 (#1) (id: 261466)

**"with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality"**

The angel is speaking as if the **kings of the earth** had literally **committed sexual immorality** with this prostitute. But that is not literally the case even within the world of this vision, since the angel explains in verse 18 that the prostitute symbolizes a city. So the sexual immorality likely symbolizes idolatry and, in light of chapter 18, greed. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth joined her in being idolatrous and greedy”

The angel is speaking as if the **sexual immorality** of the prostitute had been **wine** and that the **ones inhabiting the earth** had literally been **intoxicated** by that wine. But once again these things are not literally the case even within the world of this vision. The sexual immorality likely represents idolatry and greed and the intoxication likely represents deception. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “she deceived the ones inhabiting the earth to make them indulge in idolatry and greed”

The voice is not suggesting that God had forgotten about Babylon but has now **remembered** the city’s **offenses**. The angel is using a common biblical expression that means that God has taken action with regard to a person or entity of which he was already aware, either to help or to punish.

## Revelation 18:6 (#1) (id: 261532)

**""Give back to her even as she has given,"**

The voice from heaven is using a characteristic form of Hebrew speech. The voice is naming a number and then, for emphasis, naming the next higher number. An example of this is in [1:3](https://ref.ly/Amos1:3), “For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not turn away punishment.” If it might seem to your readers that the voice from heaven was contradicting itself, first saying to punish Babylon one way (just as much as the city hurt others) and then saying to punish Babylon a different way (twice as much as the city hurt others), you could show in your translation that this is actually a progression for emphasis. UST models one way to do this.

**""double doubles {to her} according to her deeds;"**

These two phrases mean similar things. The voice from heaven is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express.

The voice is speaking as if Babylon had literally **mixed** a **cup** of wine for others to drink. This is a reprise of the image in [14:8](https://ref.ly/Rev14:8). However, the emphasis here is on how drinking too much wine makes a person stagger. This is an image of how Babylon will stagger from God’s punishments.

**""having been dressed in fine linen"**

The merchants are speaking as if the city of Babylon had literally been **dressed** in expensive clothing and **adorned** with jewels. They mean that the people of the city lived in luxury. Even if your language does not ordinarily use figures of speech, you may wish to preserve this figure of speech in your translation so that your readers can see how the merchants were speaking about Babylon. One way to do that would be to translate it as a simile, as UST does.

In this verse, someone breaks into John’s narrative of his vision to speak directly to the audience in heaven and on earth. ULT puts the verse in parentheses to show this. There may be a comparable convention in your language that you can use in your translation. You can also state explicitly who is speaking, as UST does. That speaker could be: (1\) the voice from heaven that spoke in [18:4–8](https://ref.ly/Rev18:4-Rev18:8) or another voice from heaven. (2\) Jesus, as in [16:15](https://ref.ly/Rev16:15).

**"Rejoice"**

The implied “you” in the imperative **Rejoice** is singular here because this imperative addresses **heaven**.

The person speaking here is likely continuing to address those who serve and fear God. So by **our**, the speaker means himself and them, so use the inclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Revelation 19:8 (#2) (id: 261640)

**"For fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints"**

Here John provides some background information about the symbolism in his vision in order to help his readers understand what he is describing. ULT shows that this is background information by putting it in parentheses. This information is helpful for understanding the symbolic significance of **fine linen** and for understanding the symbolism of the book generally. See what you did with the similar background information in [1:20](https://ref.ly/Rev1:20).

## Revelation 19:12 (#1) (id: 261659)

**"his eyes also {being} a flame of fire"**

John is speaking as if the **eyes** of the one riding on the white horse were actually a **flame of fire**. This is something that could be taken literally within the world of the vision, but it is more likely that John means this as a comparison, as in [1:14](https://ref.ly/Rev1:14) and [2:18](https://ref.ly/Rev2:18). In that case, the point of the comparison would be that Jesus has eyes that are so bright and lively that they resemble a burning flame. See how you translated this earlier in the book.

Since **cubits** were the distance from an elbow to a fingertip, John needs to specify from what size person the angel determined this measurement. This could mean: (1\) that the angel appeared to John in human form and so the distance from his elbow to his fingertip was the same as that of a human. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here.

## Revelation 22:17 (#1) (id: 261858)

**"the Bride"**

In keeping with the symbolism of his vision, John is speaking of the church as if it were literally the **Bride** of Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the church”

## Revelation 22:17 (#2) (id: 261859)

**"say, “Come!”"** \- **"let the one hearing say, “Come"**

In both cases, the implied “you” in the imperative **Come** is singular, so use a singular form if your language marks that distinction. If it does not, you could indicate the addressee in another way. The addressee could be: (1\) Jesus, who says in verses 12 and 20, “I am coming quickly,” and to whom John says explicitly in v. 20, “Come, Lord Jesus!” Alternate translation: “say to Jesus, ‘Come!’ … let the one hearing say to Jesus, ‘Come!’” (2\) the **one thirsting**, whom John mentions in the next sentence. Alternate translation: Alternate translation: “say to the one thirsting, ‘Come!’ … let the one hearing say to the one thirsting, ‘Come!’”

## Revelation 22:17 (#4) (id: 261861)

**"let the one hearing say, “"** \- **"the one thirsting, let him come. The one desiring, let him take"**

If your language does not use the third\-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may the one hearing say … may the one thirsting come … may the one desiring take” or “the one hearing should say … the one thirsting should come … the one desiring should take”

**"the one hearing"** \- **"the one thirsting,"** \- **"The one desiring"**

These phrases do not refer to specific people. They refer to anyone who has the quality that they name. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “anyone who hears … anyone who thirsts … anyone who desires”

## Revelation 22:17 (#6) (id: 261863)

**"And the one thirsting, let him come. The one desiring, let him take the water of life freely"**

In [21:6](https://ref.ly/Rev21:6), God spoke as if he would literally give “water” to someone who was “thirsting.” He was using thirst to represent a person’s desire for everlasting life and he was using drinking life\-giving water to represent that person receiving everlasting life. John is echoing the same image here. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Let the one who wants to have everlasting life come. Let the one who desires everlasting life receive it freely”

## Revelation 22:17 (#7) (id: 261864)

**"And the one thirsting, let him come. The one desiring, let him take the water of life freely"**

These two sentences mean basically the same thing. John is speaking in something like Hebrew poetry, which was based on this kind of repetition. It would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if such repetition would not be natural in your language, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is thirsting come, yes, let the one desiring take the water of life freely” or “Let the one who wants to have everlasting life come, yes, let the one who desires everlasting life receive it freely”

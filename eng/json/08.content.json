It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>This book traditionally has the title <strong>Ruth</strong> because she is the main person in it. If the church prefers, you could use a fuller title such as <strong>The Book About Ruth</strong>. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26805\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">How to Translate Names</span>)</p><h3>When did the events in the book of Ruth occur?</h3><p>The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were judges in Israel. This was after the people of Israel had entered into the land of Canaan, but before they had a king. The judges were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. These leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped the people make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of them may have served only certain tribes.</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?</h3><p>In a period when Israel was often unfaithful to Yahweh, a woman from Moab showed great faith in him. The Israelites’ frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of this woman from a foreign land. This shows us that God is the God of all people, not just of Israel. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25726\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Faithful</span>)</p><h3>What important marriage custom is found in the book of Ruth?</h3><p>Israelites practiced what is called &quot;levirate marriage.&quot; In this custom, the closest male relative of a man who died without any children was obligated to provide for his widow by marrying her. Usually this would be one of the man’s brothers. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that the dead man would have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could fulfill this obligation.</p><h3>What was a &quot;kinsman-redeemer&quot;?</h3><p>A person’s close relative or relatives were expected to act as &quot;kinsmen-redeemers&quot; (2:20 ULT) for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need, fulfill obligations of levirate marriage, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family. In the book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.</p><h3>What was &quot;gleaning&quot; in the book of Ruth?</h3><p>In Israel, poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These gleaners picked up stalks of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped. In this way, poor people were able to find some food. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.</p><h3>What is covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty?</h3><p>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill. Covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty is when a person does what they said they would do according to the covenant that they had made. God made a covenant with Israel in which he promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.</p><p>The book of Ruth shows that what kinsmen-redeemers do for their relatives is part of Israel’s duties according to God’s covenant with them. The story of Boaz, Ruth, and Naomi gives examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25622\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Covenant Faith</span>)</p><h3>What function did city gates have in the ancient Near East?</h3><p>City gates in the time of Boaz were meeting places for the city elders. Elders were honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. The city walls were thick, especially at the entryways, and the gates had guard towers beside and above them. Therefore, the gateway opening provided a large shady area for public meetings and there were places for important people to sit. For this reason, Boaz and the other elders sat in the gateway.</p><p>Some English Bible versions speak of Boaz sitting at the city gate, but it may be best for translators to make clear that Boaz sat in the city gateway.</p><h2>Part 3: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>How does the book of Ruth change from one topic to another topic?</h3><p>The book of Ruth often changes to new topics or new parts of the story. The ULT uses various words to indicate these changes, such as &quot;so,&quot; &quot;then,&quot; and &quot;now.&quot; Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these changes.&quot;</p>",

This is why Naomi told her daughters to remarry.</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>Contrast</h3><p>The actions of Ruth the Moabite are intended to contrast with the actions of Naomi the Jew.

    "content": "<p>&quot;# Ruth 2 General Notes</p><h2>Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>“a man of great worth” (2:1)</h3><p>This phrase describes Boaz as having good attributes, but in a very general way. The phrase could describe a man who is physically strong and able, wealthy, or of good, godly character, or all of those things. From the context of the story, we can see that Boaz has land, servants who respect him, and he lives in a way that honors God, so it seems that this phrase is describing his wealth and character. Think about how you would describe someone like this in your language.</p><h3>&quot;Do not go to glean in another field&quot; (2:8)</h3><p>Boaz said this because he could not guarantee Ruth’s safety in another person’s field. It seems that not everyone was as gracious and obedient to the law of Moses as was Boaz. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25800\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Grace</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25959\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Law of Moses</span>)</p><h3>“kinsman-redeemer” (2:20)</h3><p>A &quot;kinsmen-redeemer&quot; was a male relative who was responsible to provide for any close member of the same clan who was in need, fulfill obligations of levirate marriage, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family.

He was also concerned with preserving Ruth’s good reputation. Displaying Boaz’s good character is an important point in this chapter.</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3><strong>So that it may be well with you</strong></h3><p>Naomi wanted Ruth to have a secure home with a good husband who would care for her. She could see that Boaz would be the best husband for her. She also thought that Boaz, as a kinsman-redeemer, had an obligation to marry her. This could be true because, even though Ruth was a Gentile by birth, she had become part of Naomi’s family and part of the nation of Israel.

This shows us that God welcomes all who trust in him.</p><h3>&quot;You also acquire Ruth the Moabite woman&quot;</h3><p>With the privilege of using the family’s land came the responsibility to take care of the widows of the family. Therefore, the relative who wanted to use Naomi’s land had to also help Ruth to have a son who would carry on the family name and inheritance and provide for her.</p><h2>Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter</h2><h3>&quot;In earlier times in Israel&quot;</h3><p>Verse seven of chapter four is a comment made by the writer of the text. This indicates that there was a considerable period of time between the events that occurred and the time when they were written down, during which customs had changed. Consider how to indicate that this is a comment about the story rather than a part of the story.&quot;</p>",

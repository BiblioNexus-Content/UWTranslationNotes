    "content": "<p>&quot;# Introduction to 2 John</p><h2>Part 1: General Introduction</h2><h3>Outline of the book of 2 John</h3><ol><li><p>Opening of letter (1:1–3)</p></li><li><p>Encouragement and the commandment to love one another (1:4–6)</p></li><li><p>Warning about false teachers (1:7–11)</p></li><li><p>Closing of letter (1:12–13)</p></li></ol><h3>Who wrote the book of 2 John?</h3><p>The author of this letter identifies himself only as “the elder.” However, the content of 2 John is similar to the content in John’s gospel and also to the content in 1 John and 3 John. This suggests that the apostle John wrote this letter, and he would have done so near the end of his life.</p><h3>To whom was the book of 2 John written?</h3><p>The author addresses this letter to someone he calls “the chosen lady” and to “her children” (1:1). Although this could refer to a specific woman and her children, that interpretation is very unlikely. More probably, this is a figurative way to refer to a specific congregation and its members. See the discussion in Part 3, below. John knew some members of this congregation or at least was told about them (1:4) and he wanted to give them instruction and encouragement.</p><h3>What is the book of 2 John about?</h3><p>It appears that John addressed this letter to a specific congregation of believers. John’s purposes in writing this letter to them was to encourage them in their faith and to warn them about false teachers. John did not want believers helping or giving money to false teachers. He probably intended this message to be passed on to all believers in general.</p><h3>How should the title of this book be translated?</h3><p>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 John” or “Second John.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Second Letter from John” or “The Second Letter John Wrote.” (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"26805\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationManual\">How to Translate Names</span>)</p><h2>Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts</h2><h3>What is hospitality?</h3><p>Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly toward foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. John wanted believers to offer hospitality to guests. However, he did not want believers to offer hospitality to false teachers.</p><h3>Who were the people John spoke against?</h3><p>The people John spoke against may have been those who later became known as Gnostics. These people believed that the physical world was evil. Since the physical body was seen as evil, they did not think that God could become human. Therefore, they believed that Jesus was divine but denied that he was human. (See: <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"25718\" data-resourceType=\"UWTranslationWords\">Evil</span>)</p><h2>Part 3: Important Translation Issues</h2><h3>Who is the “chosen lady” of 2 John 1:1?</h3><p>John addresses this letter to “the chosen lady and her children,” and a few scholars have suggested that this refers to an actual woman with children. However, the great majority of scholars understand “the chosen lady and her children” to be a figurative way to refer to a congregation and its members. A closer examination of the letter reveals that this is the case. First of all, much of the content would not make sense if addressed to an individual. Also, John addresses this “lady” using plural forms of “you” in verses 6, 8, 10, and 12. An individual would not be addressed in that way. At the end of the letter, he sends greetings from “the children of your chosen sister,” using the same figurative language to refer to his own congregation. Since the word “church” was feminine in Greek, referring to a church as a “lady” and to another church as a “sister” would be quite normal. For these reasons, these notes will present the meaning of these words as figurative, not literal.</p><h3>What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 2 John?</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2John1:8\">1:8</a>, some manuscripts read “what you have worked for” instead of “what we have worked for.” If a version of the Bible already exists in your region, you should consider using the reading of that version in your translation. If not, you may wish to follow the reading that most Bible scholars consider to be authentic and say “what we have worked for.” Scholars are divided over whether “we” includes both John and the letter recipients or includes only John and those with him, and thus excludes the letter recipients. If your language makes the distinction, you might want to use the inclusive form, since the letter recipients certainly worked to support each other&apos;s faith.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2John1:12\">1:12</a>, some manuscripts read “your joy” instead of “our joy.” If a version of the Bible already exists in your region, you should consider using the reading of that version in your translation. If not, you may wish to follow the reading that most Bible scholars consider to be authentic and say “our joy.” In this case, “our” would include both John and the letter recipients.

Rather, he spoke often throughout the time period called <strong>long ago</strong>. Then, the phrase <strong>in many ways</strong> shows that God used various means and people to speak to the <strong>fathers</strong>. The author uses both of these phrases because he wishes to emphasize the variety of times and ways in which God has <strong>spoken</strong>.

The quotation is from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:3-Hab2:4\">Habakkuk 2:3–4</a>, although the author rearranges some clauses in the following verse. Further, the phrase <strong>yet {in} a very little {while}</strong> paraphrases the beginning of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:3\">2:3</a>, and it sounds much like part of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:20\">26:20</a>.

God came down to this mountain to create a covenant with the Israelites, and Moses met him on the mountain and received God’s commands and promises. When God came to the mountain, there were loud sounds, fire, and dark clouds, and God commanded that nobody should go up the mountain except for Moses and Aaron. The Israelites were afraid and asked Moses to speak to God for them. You can read about this story in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:9-Exod20:21\">Exodus 19:9–20:21</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:9-Deut5:31\">Deuteronomy 4:9–5:31</a>.

See the book introduction for more discussion of these issues. Here, the phrase could refer to believers who: (1) used to live in <strong>Italy</strong> but now live somewhere else. This fits with the idea that the author sent this letter to Rome, which is in Italy. The people who used to live in <strong>Italy</strong> are greeting their friends back home. Alternate translation: “The ones who used to live in Italy” (2) live in <strong>Italy</strong> now. This fits with the idea that the author sends this letter from Rome to some other place, probably Jerusalem or Alexandria.

* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Dual/Plural (ID: 33319)

## Colossians 1:1 (#3) (id: 244476)

**"Paul"**

In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the first person here. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:1
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: 33256)

## Colossians 1:1 (#4) (id: 244477)

**"and Timothy our brother"**

This phrase does not mean that **Timothy** helped Paul write this letter. Paul was the author of this letter, as he shows by using the first person singular throughout the letter. What this does mean is that Timothy is with Paul and that Timothy is in agreement with what Paul writes. If it sounds in your language like Timothy is writing the letter with Paul, you could make Timothy’s supporting role more clear. Alternate translation: “with the support of Timothy, our fellow believer”

## Colossians 1:2 (#1) (id: 244478)

**"to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ in Colossae"**

In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “to you who live in the city of Colossae and who are God’s people and faithful fellow believers who are united to the Messiah”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** COL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: 33256)

## Colossians 1:2 (#2) (id: 244479)

**"to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ"**

The words **saints**, **faithful brothers**, and **in Christ** all describe people who are followers of Jesus. Paul is using all of these to describe one group of people. For example, he is not implying that **saints** and **faithful brothers in Christ** are two different groups. If it would be helpful in your language, you could join these words together in a different way. Alternate translation: “to God’s faithful people, joined together as a family in Christ”

Some later manuscripts add “through his blood” after **redemption**.

The word **firstborn** does not refer to when Jesus was born. Instead, it refers to his position as the eternal Son of God the Father. In this sense, **firstborn** is a metaphor that means that he existed as God before God created anything and that he is most important.

The words **thrones**, **dominions**, **governments**, and **authorities** here refer to different kinds of angels or other spiritual beings that are not specified as being good or evil. They are examples of what is **invisible**. It may be that the false teachers were teaching that these beings should be worshiped. But Paul is emphasizing here that God the Father created all of these spiritual beings through his Son, and so the Son is much greater than these. If it would be helpful in your language, you could: (1\) identify that these are spiritual beings and translate as many of these names as you have different words for. Alternate translation: “Including all spiritual beings, which can be called thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities” (2\) use names from your culture that identify different classes of angels or spiritual beings.

**"the lack of the afflictions of Christ"**

Here Paul is not saying that there is a **lack** in Christ’s **afflictions** because those **afflictions** did not succeed in doing what they were supposed to do.

## Colossians 2:11 (#1) (id: 244695)

**"you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in the removal of the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ"**

Here Paul uses **circumcision** as an image to describe what happens to believers when they are united to the Messiah. In the metaphor, the **circumcision** is completed **without hands**, which means that God accomplishes it. What is “removed” or cut off is the **body of flesh**, which refers to the broken and sinful parts of the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea with the language of analogy or express it plainly. Alternate translation: “you were also marked off by God as his own when he took away your body of flesh by the work of the Messiah”

**"in the circumcision of Christ"**

Here, Paul uses the possessive form to connect **circumcision** with **Christ**. This does not refer to when Christ himself was circumcised or how he himself circumcises believers. Instead, the possessive form connects the extended metaphor of circumcision with Christ’s work: the circumcision that Paul speaks about is accomplished in what Christ has done. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could make the relationship between **circumcision** and **Christ** more explicit. Alternate translation: “in the circumcision accomplished by Christ” or “in the circumcision caused by Christ”

**"having been buried with him in baptism"**

Paul here uses a metaphor that connects **baptism** to “burial” to further explain what happens to believers when they are united to Christ. This metaphor expresses how, when they are baptized, believers are united to Christ in his (death and) burial and are no longer who they once were. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea with the language of analogy, or express it plainly.

When Paul speaks of someone **being dead in** something, this identifies both why and in what state the person is dead. In other words, the Colossians were **dead** because of their **trespasses** and because of their **uncircumcision**, and these things also characterized them while they were dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase like “because of,” or you could translate **trespasses** and **uncircumcision** as descriptors of **dead**.

Paul speaks of the way God forgives our sins as if God **canceled** debts that we owed him. In the metaphor, God has crossed out or erased the **written record** of those debts and thus removed any impact these debts have on our relationship to him.

Because of these things that have happened, the Colossians should not allow others to judge them in how they behave. Paul is continuing the warning against false teachers that he started in [2:8](https://ref.ly/Col2:8).

In this verse Paul uses an extended metaphor in which Christ is the **head** of the **body**, which is his church, which has **joints** and **ligaments**, and which **grows**. Paul uses this metaphor to describe how Christ leads, directs, nourishes, and unifies his church to help it become what he wants it to be. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea using the language of analogy, or express it plainly. Alternate translation: “to the Messiah, from whom the whole church receives nourishment and leadership and in whom the church is united as it grows with the growth from God”

**"and"** \- **"the joints"** \- **"ligaments"**

The word **joints** refers to where parts of the body are connected together, while the word translated **ligaments** refers to what holds these parts together. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use technical terms that correspond to **joints** and **ligaments**, or you could use more general language for what holds the body together.

**"with the growth from God"**

Paul here speaks of **growth** that is **from God** to show that the church’s **growth** is given by **God** and fits with what **God** desires. If your language would not use this form to express that idea, you could express the idea with a relative clause.

## Colossians 2:20 (#2) (id: 244750)

**"you died with Christ"**

Paul now returns to a metaphor he has used earlier: believers have died and “been buried with” Christ ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Col2:12)). This means that, in their union with Christ, believers share in his death so that they too have died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the language of analogy, or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “you participated in the Messiah’s death”

## Colossians 2:20 (#3) (id: 244751)

**"you died with Christ from"**

To “die from” something does not identify what caused the death, but rather it indicates what the death separated the person from. Here, then, the Colossians were separated from the **elemental principles** by participating in Christ’s death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you died with Christ, which separated you from” or “you died with Christ, which rescued you from”

**"living in the world"**

Paul uses the verb **living** to describe the Colossian’s way of life. They are indeed physically alive and in the world, but he wants them to behave in ways that do not match what people **in the world** normally do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a verbal phrase such as “belonging to” or “conforming to.” Alternate translation: “belonging to the world” or “conforming to the world”

In this context, the word **as** introduces something that is not true: the Colossians do not actually live **in the world**. If **as** would be misunderstood your language, you could clarify that **living in the world** is not true of the Colossians, using a phrase such as “as if.” Alternate translation: “as if living in the world”

**"why, as living in the world, are you being subjected to its decrees"**

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. Here, there is no answer to the question, since that is exactly Paul’s point. There is no reason for them to be **subjected to its decrees**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as an imperative or a “should” statement. Alternate translation: “do not, as living in the world, be subjected to its decrees” or “you should not, as living in the world, be subjected to its decrees”

## Colossians 2:21 (#1) (id: 244759)

**"You may not handle, nor taste, nor touch"**

This verse gives three commands that are not from Paul, but rather they are examples of the “decrees” from [2:20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20). If it would be helpful in your language, you could introduce these commands with a phrase, such as “for example,” that shows that they connect to the “decrees” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “for example, ‘You may not handle, nor taste, nor touch!’”

* **Associated Passages:** COL 2:21

## Colossians 2:21 (#2) (id: 244760)

**"You may not handle, nor taste, nor touch"**

Paul does not express what these commands say not to **handle**, **taste**, or **touch**, but it is clear that only certain things would be included, not all things. If your language would make this information explicit, you could add a generic phrase such as “certain things” or use words that match each command. Alternate translation: “You may not handle certain objects, nor taste certain foods and drinks, nor touch certain people”

**"You may"** \- **"handle,"** \- **"taste,"** \- **"touch"**

These commands are addressed to **You** in the singular. Most likely, Paul refers to specific commands given to one person in a specific situation. However, he does intend these to be taken as examples of commands that might be given to any person among the Colossians. If your language can use a command in the singular as a generic example, you could do so here. If this does not make sense in your language, you could use plural commands here.

**"are all for destruction with the use"**

This phrase means that all the objects that the commands in the previous verse are about end up being destroyed when they are used. In other words, food and drink are destroyed when they are eaten, and tools eventually break when they are used. By describing the objects in this way, Paul shows that the rules about these objects are not very important. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this phrase differently, such as with a verbal phrase.

**"which, having indeed a word of wisdom in self\-made religion and false humility {and} severity of the body"**

While there is no grammatical marker for a condition here, the word **in** functionally introduces a condition: these commands have a **word of wisdom** “if” one values **self\-made religion and false humility and severity of the body**. It is only if one values these things that the commands have wisdom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea by using a conditional expression, or use the word “seem.” Alternate translation: “which, having indeed a word of wisdom if one values self\-made religion and false humility and severity of the body” or “which, seeming to have a word or wisdom for those who practice self\-made religion and false humility and severity of the body”

## Colossians 3:4 (#4) (id: 244797)

**"is revealed,"** \- **"will be revealed with him"**

Paul uses the word **is revealed** to refer to Christ’s second coming, when he is **revealed** to everyone as who he truly is. Paul uses the phrase **will be revealed with him** to refer to how the Colossians will participate with Christ in that second coming and also be **revealed** as who they truly are. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words such as “coming” or “returning” instead of “revealing.” Alternate translation: “comes again … will come with him” or “returns … will return with him”

**"When"** \- **"then"**

The word **When** indicates a moment in time, and the word translated **then** refers back to that same time. Therefore, the events described in two parts of this sentence occur at the same time.

**"therefore"**

Here, the word **therefore** introduces an exhortation based on previous statements. In this case, Paul bases his exhortation on what he has said about the Colossians’ union with Christ and its end goal: being revealed with him in glory. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable connecting word or express the idea with a phrase that refers back to what Paul has already said.

**"must"** \- **"lay aside"**

Here Paul exhorts the Colossians to **lay aside** sins as if the sins were garments that they could take off or objects they could set down and stop using. By talking this way, Paul encourages the Colossians to no longer use or be associated with sins that are not part of who they are in their union with Christ, just as clothes and objects are not part of the person but can be removed.

**"having taken off the old man"**

Here Paul uses a metaphor that is similar to one he used in [2:11](https://ref.ly/Col2:11), where he speaks of the “circumcision of Christ” that “puts off” the body of flesh. Here, he speaks of the **old man** as if it were a piece of clothing that the Colossians could “take off.” This does not mean that their true selves are found underneath the **old man**, since the next verse has them putting on the **new man**. Instead, Paul uses the metaphor to illustrate how they have changed identity from **old** to “new.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it plainly. Alternate translation: “having forsaken your old identity”

## Colossians 3:9 (#3) (id: 244831)

**"the old man"**

Paul uses the phrase **the old man** as part of his language about dying and rising with Christ. The **old man** is thus the person who died with Christ. It does not refer to a part of the person, but rather, it refers to what the whole person used to be before dying with Christ. This is why the ULT uses the neuter pronoun **its** to refer to **old man** later in the verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a term that refers to the whole person and who he or she used to be. Alternate translation: “the old ‘you’” or “your old identity”

Translate this clause with the same structure you used in the previous verse. This clause could: (1\) give the reason why the Colossians should not lie to each other (and should put off the sins listed in the [3:8](https://ref.ly/Col3:8)).

They all fit into the category of the “new man” now. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea without the hyperbole by emphasizing the new unity of people from all these categories. Alternate translation: “all people are the same,”

**"let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts"**

Paul speaks of the **peace of Christ** as if it should be the “ruler” in the Colossians’ hearts. The word **rule** is closely related to the word translated “deprive of your prize” that Paul uses in [2:18](https://ref.ly/Col2:18): both are used of a judge or an umpire making a decision, although in [2:18](https://ref.ly/Col2:18), the judge or umpire decides against the Colossians. Here, the idea is that the **peace of Christ** acts as the judge or umpire in the **hearts** of the Colossians, which means that this **peace** helps them decide what to feel and do.

## Colossians 3:17 (#4) (id: 244899)

**"in the name of the Lord Jesus"**

Acting **in the name of** a person means representing that person. Representatives, those who do anything **in the name of** someone else, should act so as to help others think well of and honor the people they represent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom for representing someone or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “as representatives of the Lord Jesus” or “in a way that leads to honor for the Lord Jesus”

**"through him"**

The phrase **through him** does not mean that the prayers of thanks are mediated to God the Father by God the Son. Rather, it is **through** the Son that the Colossians are able to give thanks. This means that they can give thanks because of what the Son has done for them. If that meaning of **through him** would not be understood in your language, you could express the idea with a preposition such as “because” or clarify that it is **through** the “work” of the Son. Alternate translation: “because of what he has done” or “through his work”

Paul, then, speaks as if **the one doing unrighteousness** will **receive** as payment or recompense exactly **what he did unrighteously**. By this, Paul means that God will punish those who do **unrighteousness** in a way that fits with what they did.

**"give to your slaves {what is} right and fair"**

Here Paul speaks of how masters treat their slaves as if the master were “giving” the treatment of their slaves. By this, he means that the thing given (**{what is} right and fair**) is what characterizes the master’s dealing with the slave. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea by using adverbs such as “rightly” and “fairly” with a verb such as “treat.” Alternate translation: “act rightly and fairly towards your slaves”

**"a master in heaven"**

The words **Masters** and **master** are usually translated “lords” and “Lord” elsewhere. However, here they are translated **Masters** and **master** because the relationship between slaves and their masters, or “lords,” is in view. Paul wishes the **Masters** to treat their slaves justly because they also serve a “Master,” the Lord Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea by identifying that the **master** is the Lord Jesus. Alternate translation: “a master in heaven, the Lord Jesus”

## Colossians 4:11 (#6) (id: 245014)

**"These {are} the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God being from the circumcision, who were a comfort to me"**

Paul here describes the three men in two ways. First, he identifies them as the **only** ones among his **fellow workers** who are Jewish (**from the circumcision**). In other words, Paul distinguishes them from all the other people who work with him, because these three men are the only ones who are circumcised Jews. Second, he describes them as ones **who have been a comfort** to him. Here, he is not distinguishing them from other fellow workers; instead, he just wishes to say that they have **been a comfort** to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the two descriptions differently so that it is clear that the first distinguishes the three men while the second describes the three men. Alternate translation: “Out of all my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, these are the only ones being from the circumcision, and they have been a comfort to me”

**"striving on behalf of you in prayers"**

The word **striving** is usually used for attempting to win a contest, whether that is athletic, military, or legal. While Epaphras is not actually participating in an athletic or military contest, Paul uses the metaphor to explain how earnestly Epaphras prays for the Colossians.

**"you may stand complete and fully assured in all the will of God"**

Here Paul speaks as if the Colossians can **stand complete and fully assured in all the will of God**. By this, he means that they should consistently do God’s will, just as if God’s will served as a foundation underneath them. The words **complete and fully assured** explain the way in which they are supposed to **stand** or continue to obey.

The word **For** introduces further support for Paul’s statements about Epaphras in the previous verse. In [4:12](https://ref.ly/Col4:12), Paul says that Epaphras is “always striving” for them, and he supports that claim here by giving his own testimony about how hard Epaphras has worked for the Colossians and for other believers who live near them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a previous statement, or you could refer back to what Paul is supporting.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **the ones** refers to believers who live in these two towns.

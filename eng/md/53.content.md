## 2 Thessalonians 1:1 (#1) (id: 247125)

**"Silvanus"**

**Silvanus** is the Latin form of “Silas.” **Silvanus** is the name of a man, the same person listed in the book of Acts as Paul’s fellow traveler. If your readers may not know that these two are the same person, you could use the name “Silas” in the text and “Silvanus” in the footnote.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:1 (#2) (id: 247126)

**"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church"**

You may want to fill in the words necessary to make this a complete sentence. Alternate translation: “Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy send this letter to the church”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:1 (#3) (id: 247127)

**"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy"**

Although **Paul** wrote this letter, he identifies **Silvanus and Timothy** as also sending it. This means that they were with him and were in agreement with it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that clear, as in the UST.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:1 (#4) (id: 247128)

**"in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"**

Here Paul speaks of the believers as though they were occupying space inside of God and Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “sharing life with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:2 (#1) (id: 247129)

**"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"**

Many languages have different ways to offer good wishes as they greet. Paul greeted his letter recipients with a blessing. Use a form that would be a good wish or blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “We pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace” or “I wish you grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “May the grace and peace of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be your portion” or “May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ show grace and give peace to your hearts”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:2 (#2) (id: 247130)

**"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"**

If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **Grace** and **peace**, you can express these ideas as verbs or in another way. Alternate translation: “May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be gracious to you and give rest to your inner being” or “...be favorable to you and make you at ease” or “...be kind to you and set your heart at rest”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3 (#1) (id: 247131)

**""**

General Information:\\n\\nIn verses 3–12, Paul gives thanks for the believers in Thessalonica and prays for them. A heading for this section might be, “Thanks and Prayers.”

See:

* **Associated Passages:** 2TH 1:3

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3 (#2) (id: 247132)

**"We ought always to give thanks"**

Paul here uses the word **ought** to express that he has a moral obligation to God to **give thanks** for the believers in Thessalonica. Use a natural expression for this in your language. Alternate translation: “We are bound always to thank” or “We can do no other than to thank” or “We must give thanks continually to”

* **Associated Passages:** 2TH 1:3

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3 (#3) (id: 247133)

**"We ought always to give thanks to God"**

Paul uses **always** as a generalization meaning “often” or “regularly.” Alternate translation: “We should often give thanks to God”

* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: `33281@UWTranslationManual`)

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3 (#4) (id: 247134)

**"We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers"**

If your readers might think that Paul is expressing an obligation only and that he does not actually pray for the Thessalonians, you could express the reality explicitly. Alternate translation: “We always thank God for you, brothers, as we ought”

* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: `33273@UWTranslationManual`)

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3 (#5) (id: 247135)

**"brothers"**

Here, **brothers** means fellow Christians, including both men and women. If your readers understand that it is addressed only to men, you may need to use both the masculine and the feminine forms of that word in your language. If you use a nonfigurative word such as “believers”, see that both the genders are addressed. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3 (#6) (id: 247136)

**"just as it is fitting"**

If it is difficult to express **just as it is fitting** in your language or if it is unclear what **it** refers to, consider starting a new sentence here to state it clearly. Alternate translation: “When we give thanks for you we are doing the right thing” or “Giving thanks for you is right for us to be doing” or “ \& is the right thing to do”

**"your endurance and faith"**

If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **endurance** and **faith** or if it is unclear how these two terms relate, you can express these same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “how you patiently continue to trust in Jesus” or “how you persevere in believing in the Lord”

See: Abstract Nouns

* **Associated Passages:** 2TH 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: `33257@UWTranslationManual`)

## 2 Thessalonians 1:4 (#3) (id: 247142)

**"in all your persecutions and afflictions"**

The two words **persecutions** and **afflictions** are saying very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize how difficult life has been for the Thessalonian believers. If two words are difficult to find in your language or if your language does not use repetition in this way, you can use one word with this meaning and make the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “as you have been going through all these very difficult times” or “as people make you suffer in all the ways”

* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: `33266@UWTranslationManual`)

## 2 Thessalonians 1:4 (#4) (id: 247143)

**"faith in all your persecutions"**

Here, **faith in all your persecutions** does not mean to believe in or trust in persecutions. If your readers might be confused by that, you could express it more clearly. Alternate translation: “faith in Jesus Christ during all the times you are persecuted”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:5 (#1) (id: 247144)

**"evidence of the righteous judgment of God, for you to be considered worthy"**

The **evidence** that Paul is referring to here is the faithful endurance of the Thessalonian believers while suffering persecution, which he mentioned in verse 4\. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may also be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Your endurance while suffering is a clear indication of God’s righteous judgment, that he considers you worthy” or “Your faithfulness through persecution shows that God is just and right to consider you worthy”

## 2 Thessalonians 1:6 (#1) (id: 247147)

**"if indeed {it is} righteous for God"**

Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you know that God is just” or “for God is certainly right”

**"for God to return affliction to the ones afflicting you"**

Here, **to return** means to cause someone to experience the same thing that they did to someone else as though the same action were bouncing back onto the people who did that action. Use a natural expression for this kind of reciprocal action. Alternate translation: “for God to afflict those who are afflicting you” or “for God to pay back those who are afflicting you” “for God to do the same to those who are afflicting you”

Here, **and he may fulfill** adds another reason why Paul and his associates **pray always** for the Thessalonian believers.

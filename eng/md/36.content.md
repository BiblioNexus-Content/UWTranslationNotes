## Zephaniah 1:1 (#1) (id: 279293)

**"The word of Yahweh that was to Zephaniah"**

In this title for the book, the term **word** refers to the message that Yahweh sent to the Judeans through Zephaniah by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The message that Yahweh sent through Zephaniah”

## Zephaniah 1:1 (#2) (id: 279294)

**"the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah"**

The author is describing the ancestors of **Zephaniah** in order to introduce him to readers as a key participant in the book, the person through whom Yahweh spoke the messages that the book records. Your culture may have its own way of introducing people by describing their ancestors, and if so, you can use it here in your translation.

## Zephaniah 1:1 (#4) (id: 279296)

**"in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah"**

In this title, the term **days** means a specific time, the reign of **Josiah** as **king of Judah**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “during the reign of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah”

## Zephaniah 1:2 (#1) (id: 279297)

**"Removing, I will exterminate everything from upon the face of the ground”—the declaration of Yahweh"**

Zephaniah is using the phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** to indicate that he is quoting the message that Yahweh has given him for the people of Judah. Consider natural ways of identifying direct quotations in your language. It may be more natural for you to put this attribution of the saying to Yahweh before the saying itself, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “This is what Yahweh declares: ‘Removing, I will exterminate everything from upon the face of the ground’”

See: Quotations and Quote Margins

* **Associated Articles:** Quotations and Quote Margins (ID: 33426)

## Zephaniah 1:2 (#2) (id: 279298)

**"Removing, I will exterminate everything from upon the face of the ground"**

When Yahweh says that he is going to destroy **everything** on the surface of the earth, he is probably making an overstatement for emphasis. He wants to express how angry he is at the sinful disobedience of people. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “I will cause very great destruction on the earth”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: 33281)

## Zephaniah 1:2 (#3) (id: 279299)

**"Removing, I will exterminate everything"**

Yahweh is using one verb and a different verb of similar meaning together in order to intensify the idea that these verbs express. Ordinarily in this construction, the same verb would be used twice. But here two verbs of similar sound and meaning are used for poetic effect and emphasis. If your language can repeat verbs for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If it has two verbs of similar sound and meaning that you can use, that would reflect the poetic effect here. Your language may also have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will totally exterminate everything”

## Zephaniah 1:2 (#4) (id: 279300)

**"the face of the ground"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the surface of the earth or ground were literally its **face**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the surface of the earth”

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#1) (id: 279301)

**"the declaration of Yahweh"**

See how you translated the phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** in the previous verse. If you used it to introduce the quotation there, you may wish to do the same thing here.

* **Associated Articles:** Quotations and Quote Margins (ID: 33426)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#2) (id: 279302)

**""I will take away man and beast;"**

Yahweh is using creatures from the three components of creation—land creatures, sky creatures, and **sea** creatures—to mean all creatures throughout creation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “I will take away all the creatures that live everywhere in creation”

See: Merism

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Merism (ID: 33291)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#3) (id: 279303)

**""man and beast;"**

Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that clearly includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “humans and beasts … humans”

See: When Masculine Words Include Women

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: 33276)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#4) (id: 279304)

**"man and beast"**

Yahweh is using two types of creatures that live on the earth, **man** and **beast**, to mean all creatures that live on the earth. If you would like to retain in your translation the references in this verse to the three different parts of creation, you could explain the meaning of this reference. Alternate translation: “all the creatures that live on the earth”

See: Merism

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Merism (ID: 33291)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#5) (id: 279305)

**"and the stumbling blocks with the wicked"**

Yahweh is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and the stumbling blocks with wicked people”

See: Nominal Adjectives

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Nominal Adjectives (ID: 33294)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#6) (id: 279306)

**"and the stumbling blocks"**

Yahweh is speaking of idols as if they were literally **stumbling blocks**, that is, objects that people would trip over. He is using stumbling to mean doing what is morally and spiritually wrong. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the idols”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#7) (id: 279307)

**"with the wicked"**

The implication is that the **wicked** people Yahweh is talking about are doing things that are morally and spiritually wrong because their actions are being guided by the values implicit in idolatry rather than by Yahweh’s law. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “with the people who are wicked because they worship idols”

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#8) (id: 279308)

**"and I will cut off man from upon the face of the ground"**

When Yahweh says that he will kill all the people who live on earth, as in verse 2, he is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “and the wicked people who are disobeying me, I will punish by killing them”

See: Hyperbole

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Hyperbole (ID: 33281)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#9) (id: 279309)

**"and I will cut off man"**

Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “and I will cut off all people”

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** When Masculine Words Include Women (ID: 33276)

## Zephaniah 1:3 (#10) (id: 279310)

**"and I will cut off man"**

Yahweh is speaking as if he were going to **cut off** the people who live on the earth the way one would cut a branch off from a tree. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy all people” or “and I will eliminate all people”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#1) (id: 279312)

**"And I will stretch out my hand"**

Here, **hand** represents the power that a person has to do something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And I will use my power”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#2) (id: 279313)

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#3) (id: 279314)

**"and I will cut off from this place"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this phrase is the beginning of a litany. You may use that discussion to help you consider how to format the material in verses 4–6\.

See: Litany

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Litany (ID: 33289)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#4) (id: 279315)

**"the remnant of Baal"**

Yahweh is using the name **Baal** by association to mean the worship of Baal, a false god. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the remnant of Baal\-worship”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#5) (id: 279316)

**"the remnant of Baal"**

The worship of **Baal** had not been reduced to a **remnant** at this time. As the General Introduction to Zephaniah explains, the prophet spoke these oracles to warn the people of Judah that they needed to stop worshiping Baal. So Yahweh is using this expression to mean that he will destroy Baal worship so completely that nothing is left—there will be no remnant. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “every last trace of Baal worship”

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#6) (id: 279317)

**"the name of the idol\-priests with the priests"**

Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “yes, I will cut off the name of the idol\-priests with the priests” or “yes, I will destroy the name of the idol\-priests with the priests”

See: Ellipsis

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: 33267)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#7) (id: 279318)

**"the name of"**

Here, **name** represents the reputation of an individual, which extends beyond the place and time in which that individual is known personally. When someone’s **name** in this sense is destroyed, no one remembers that person any longer. Alternate translation: “the memory of”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:4
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Zephaniah 1:4 (#8) (id: 279319)

**"with the priests"**

The term **priests** probably refers to the priests descended from Aaron who were supposed to lead the Israelites in the worship of Yahweh. Unfortunately, at this time they were not serving Yahweh faithfully, as Zephaniah says in [3:4](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:4). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “along with the degenerate priests from the line of Aaron”

## Zephaniah 1:5 (#1) (id: 279320)

**""and the ones bowing down on the housetops"**

Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and I will cut off the ones bowing down on the housetops to the army of the skies, and I will cut off the ones bowing down, swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king” or “and I will destroy the ones bowing down on the housetops to the army of the skies, and I will destroy the ones bowing down, swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king”

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Ellipsis (ID: 33267)

## Zephaniah 1:5 (#2) (id: 279321)

**""and the ones bowing down on the housetops"**

Yahweh is using one aspect of worship, **bowing down**, to mean worship generally. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy the ones who worship the army of”

**"to the army of the skies"**

Yahweh is speaking of the sun, moon, and stars as if they were an **army** in the **skies**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the heavenly bodies”

See: Metaphor

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Zephaniah 1:5 (#4) (id: 279323)

**""and the ones bowing down,"**

Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and the ones bowing down, swearing to me”

See: First, Second or Third Person

* **Associated Passages:** ZEP 1:5
* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: 33256)

## Zephaniah 1:5 (#5) (id: 279324)

**""and the ones bowing down,"**

The terms **bowing down** and **swearing to** mean similar things. They both indicate worship; **bowing down**, one aspect of worship, represents worship generally, while the expression **swearing to** describes pledging oneself to worship Yahweh as God. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis since, as the rest of the verse shows, this worship was not wholehearted. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the ones appearing to worship me devotedly”

See: Doublet

* **Associated Articles:** Doublet (ID: 33266)

## Zephaniah 1:5 (#6) (id: 279325)

**"swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king"**

The word translated **their king** could be the name of a false god, Milcom, also called Molech, Molek, or Moloch. If you choose to use the name in your translation, spell it the way it sounds in your language. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the spelling that it uses. Alternate translation: “swearing to me but swearing by Milcom”

* **Associated Articles:** How to Translate Names (ID: 33391)

## Zephaniah 1:5 (#7) (id: 279326)

**"swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king"**

Yahweh is drawing a contrast between **swearing to** and **swearing by**. The Judeans who swore **to** Yahweh pledged themselves to worship him as their God. But they then swore **by** Milcom, invoking the name of that false god to guarantee a vow or promise that they had made. Yahweh is saying how inconsistent and inappropriate it was for them to do that. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “pledging themselves to worship me but then guaranteeing their oaths by invoking the false god Milcom”

* **Associated Articles:** First, Second or Third Person (ID: 33256)

## Zephaniah 1:6 (#2) (id: 279328)

**""and the ones turning back from after Yahweh,"**

Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. This could be describing: (1\) two groups, people who are no longer actively worshiping Yahweh and people who still worship Yahweh formally but who do not relate to him actively as their God. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy those who have stopped worshiping me actively, and I will destroy those who still worship me formally but do not relate to me actively as their God” (2\) one group, people who show that they are no longer worshiping Yahweh by the way they no longer relate to him actively as their God. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy those who show they have stopped worshiping me by the way they no longer relate to me actively as their God”

## Zephaniah 1:6 (#3) (id: 279329)

**"and the ones turning back from after Yahweh"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the Judeans who are ceasing to worship him were literally walking on a path and **turning back** from the direction in which they had been heading. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy the ones who have stopped worshiping me”

* **Associated Articles:** Metaphor (ID: 33292)

## Zephaniah 1:6 (#4) (id: 279330)

**"and who do not search for Yahweh and do not seek him"**

Yahweh could be using the expressions **search for** and **seek** to mean: (1\) two similar things. He could be speaking as if the Judeans should literally have been looking for him, meaning that they should have been praying to him. In this case Yahweh would be using two similar terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase Alternate translation: “and I will destroy the ones who no longer pray to me at all” (2\) two different things. The expression **search for** could mean to ask for help, and the expression **seek** could mean to ask for guidance. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy those who no longer ask for my help or guidance”

## Zephaniah 1:7 (#1) (id: 279331)

**"Hush from the face of Lord Yahweh"**

Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “Hush in the presence of Lord Yahweh”

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

## Zephaniah 1:7 (#2) (id: 279332)

**"Hush from the face of Lord Yahweh"**

The word **Hush** is an exclamation that urges listeners to be silent. In your translation, you may choose to use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. You could also translate the word as an imperative. Alternate translation: “Shh! in the presence of Lord Yahweh”

See: Exclamations

* **Associated Articles:** Idiom (ID: 33283)

## Zephaniah 1:7 (#4) (id: 279334)

**""Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice,"**

Zephaniah is speaking as if Yahweh had literally **prepared a sacrifice** and ceremonially cleansed (**sanctified**) those he had **invited** to share a meal from the meat of the sacrificed animal. He is speaking of the people of Judah as if they were this sacrifice, and of an enemy army, most likely that of the Babylonians, as if it would feast on the Judeans, meaning that this foreign power would conquer them and plunder them, as verses 13–16 indicate. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is going to allow a foreign army to conquer and plunder the land of Judah”

**"on the day of the sacrifice of Yahweh"**

As Zephaniah did in the previous verse, Yahweh is speaking as if he is literally going to offer a sacrifice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on the day when I punish you Judeans for your sins”

## Zephaniah 1:8 (#6) (id: 279341)

**"the princes"**

In some languages the term **princes** describes male direct descendants of a monarch, but here it means court officials who may or may not have been members of the royal family. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the court officials”

## Zephaniah 1:8 (#7) (id: 279342)

**"the sons of the king"**

This could mean: (1\) the actual members of the royal family. In that case, the word **sons** would have a generic sense, applying to both men and women, and it would mean not just the literal children of the present king but also the grandchildren and even later descendants of previous kings. Alternate translation: “the royal family” (2\) the literal sons of the present king, Josiah, who would have been just boys at this time. The implication is that Yahweh is going to punish the Judeans so thoroughly that not even children will be spared. Alternate translation: “even the king’s young boys”

**"all the ones leaping over the threshold"**

The expression **leaping over the threshold** seems to refer to people entering other people’s houses forcibly, as if in a rush, in order to seize their possessions by **violence** or **fraud**.

**"the ones filling the house of their lords {with} violence and fraud"**

Yahweh is using the plural form **lords** in a context where the singular term “lord” would suffice. This suggests that he may be using the plural form as a superlative to indicate the supreme example of its own class, in which case this would be a reference to the king, the lord or master of the Judeans. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “who have filled the house of their king with violence and fraud” or “who have filled the royal palace with violence and fraud”

**"the men thickening on their sediment"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the sinful, complacent people of Jerusalem were literally wine that is **thickening** because it has been left on its **sediment**. The term “sediment” describes the small pieces of stem, leaves, and seeds from grape plants that are unintentionally mixed with the juice during the winemaking process. Ordinarily, these are allowed to settle to the bottom of the wine, which is then poured off to separate it from them. Yahweh means that just as wine left on its sediment becomes thick, so these Judeans have become difficult to motivate to repentance. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. You may wish to represent the image as a comparison and explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “the people who have become so complacent” or “the people who have become so complacent that they are like wine that has thickened because no one has poured it off its sediment”

When the Israelites first left Egypt, he told them through Moses that if they did those things, “You shall build a house but not live in it; you shall plant a vineyard but not use it” ([28:30](https://ref.ly/Deut28:30)).

To indicate that in your translation, you could present this as a direct quotation, using second\-level quotation marks or some other convention of your language.

**"all of the inhabitants of the earth"**

Since Yahweh does not kill righteous people along with wicked people, the word **all** may be a generalization for emphasis, or the expression **the inhabitants of the earth** may refer specifically to wicked people.

The word translated **hastened** could mean: (1\) that Yahweh will quickly do what he is describing.

**""Gather yourselves together!"**

## Zephaniah 2:1 (#2) (id: 279400)

**""Gather yourselves together!"**

The word **yourselves** is plural because Zephaniah is addressing the Judeans as a group. The implied “you” in each of these imperative forms is also plural. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (The word “you” and the implied “you” in imperatives continue to be plural in verses 2 and 3\.)

The phrase translated **not desired** could mean: (1\) that Yahweh does not want to be close to this nation because he is so angry with its people over their sinfulness and idolatry. Alternate translation: “O nation with whom Yahweh is so angry” (2\) that the people of this nation are not ashamed of the wrong things that they have been doing.

**"before the bringing forth of the decree"**

Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe something **bringing forth** the **decree** but to speak of the **decree** as if it would be **bringing forth** something, that is, as if it would literally be giving birth to something. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to use plain language. Alternate translation: “before the decree takes effect”

These two phrases mean similar things. Zephaniah is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. However, rather than combine the phrases and show the emphasis in another way, it may be good to include both phrases in your translation, since they are part of a litany. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of the litany form and how you might format verses 1–2 to show that Zephaniah is using this form.

## Zephaniah 2:2 (#6) (id: 279409)

**"before the burning of the nose of Yahweh does not come upon you"**

Zephaniah is using a negative expression to describe an outcome that he is urging the people of Judah to avoid. He is effectively telling them to pursue the purpose of avoiding that outcome. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. The clause itself may be negative or positive, depending on the conventions of your language.

## Zephaniah 2:2 (#7) (id: 279410)

**"before the burning of the nose of Yahweh does not come upon you"**

Zephaniah is using the term **nose** to mean anger. He is doing this by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, in your translation you could use an expression involving that part of the body. You could also use plain language. Zephaniah is also speaking as if Yahweh’s **nose** or anger were literally **burning**. He means that Yahweh’s anger is very intense. Alternate translation: “so that Yahweh’s fierce anger does not come upon you” or “lest Yahweh’s fierce anger come upon you”

Zephaniah is using the adjective **humble** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

## Zephaniah 2:9 (#4) (id: 279449)

**""Moab will become like Sodom,"**

The point of this comparison is that just as **Sodom** and **Gomorrah** were completely destroyed (see [Genesis 19:1–29](https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:29)), so the countries of **Moab** and **Ammon** will be completely destroyed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. See how you translated the word “Moab” and the expression “the sons of Ammon” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the country of Moab will be completely destroyed, as the city of Sodom was, and the people of Ammon will be completely destroyed, as the people of the city of Gomorrah were”

## Zephaniah 2:9 (#5) (id: 279450)

**""a possession of the nettle and the pit of salt"**

Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They will become a possession of the nettle and the pit of salt and a ruin forever”

**""a possession of the nettle and the pit of salt"**

Yahweh is not referring to a specific **nettle** or **pit of salt**. He means nettles and salt pits in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “a possession of nettles and salt pits and a ruin forever”

**""a possession of the nettle and the pit of salt"**

Yahweh is speaking as if nettles and salt pits would literally own or possess the territory where the Moabites and Ammonites formerly lived. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a place where only weeds grow and where people dig for salt and where no one will ever build any buildings again”

## Zephaniah 2:9 (#8) (id: 279453)

**""The remnant of my people will plunder them,"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The remnant of my people will plunder them; indeed, the remainder of my nation will occupy them”

**""This will be to them instead of their pride,"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

## Zephaniah 2:10 (#2) (id: 279455)

**"This will be to them instead of their pride"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the **pride** of the Moabites and Ammonites were literally an object that belonged to them. He is also speaking as if the destruction they are going to experience were also an object and as if he were going to take away their pride and give them destruction in its place. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This will happen to them because they were so proud”

## Zephaniah 2:11 (#1) (id: 279458)

**"he will starve all of the gods of the earth"**

Zephaniah is speaking as if Yahweh is literally going to **starve** the false **gods** that other nations worship, that is, deny them food so that they become thin. This is likely a reference to the fat of animals that people sacrificed to gods. The implication is that people will no longer sacrifice to those gods because they will no longer worship them once Yahweh has shown that he is the only true and powerful God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will show by his powerful actions that he is the only true God”

**"And all of the islands of the nations will bow down to him"**

Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe **islands** that belong to **nations** but to describe island\-nations among the nations. The term **islands** can describe not just land that is completely surrounded by water but also land along a seacoast. In Zephaniah’s culture, people used the term to refer to distant lands.

The phrase **a man** refers to an individual. In this context it could mean an individual nation or an individual person.

## Zephaniah 2:14 (#4) (id: 279472)

**"will lodge on its columns"**

The word translated **columns** refers specifically to the tops of columns, which often had ornate decorations. The implication is that an army will have destroyed the elaborate buildings of Nineveh so that only columns remain standing, and they are not supporting a roof, so their tops are exposed and provide a roosting place for birds. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will roost on top of the exposed columns of its destroyed buildings”

Zephaniah is describing how badly Nineveh will be destroyed by referring to the fact that the costly and elaborate **cedar\-work** of its ornate buildings will be exposed to the elements. Alternate translation: “Because the city will be destroyed so thoroughly that the cedar\-work will be bare, a call will hoot in the window; devastation will be in the threshold”

Zephaniah is actually addressing the people of Jerusalem who have been doing these things.

Zephaniah is saying that these judges are like wolves that eat an entire animal at once when they kill it in the evening or at night, leaving not even this final task for the morning.

He could mean: (1\) that they are frivolous in character and so what they say is not profound or significant.

Alternate translation: “They treat others treacherously” (2\) that they are not faithful to Yahweh, that is, they do not speak only messages that Yahweh has given them.

If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. The word **holy** could be referring to: (1\) the temple, as a holy place set apart for the worship of Yahweh. Alternate translation: “treat the temple as if it were just an ordinary place” (2\) in addition to the temple, all of the clothing, equipment, and food that was set apart for the use of the priests in leading the people in the worship of Yahweh. Alternate translation: “treat the special things that they are supposed to use in worship as if they were ordinary things”

**""In the morning, in the morning he gives his justice;"**

The word **light** could mean: (1\) the light of dawn. In that case, Zephaniah would be saying the same thing twice in slightly different ways for emphasis. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition. To reflect this, you may wish to include both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If you do that, it may be helpful to add a connecting word in order to show that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “In the morning, in the morning he gives his justice; indeed, at dawn he is not left out” (2\) visibility, representing how Yahweh makes **justice** evident. In that case, the phrase **at light** would apply to the first clause rather than to the second one. Alternate translation: “In the morning, in the morning he brings his justice to light; he is not left out” or “In the morning, in the morning he makes his justice evident; indeed, he does not fail to do that”

## Zephaniah 3:8 (#2) (id: 279521)

**""Therefore wait for me”—the declaration of Yahweh—"**

The imperative **wait** is plural, so Yahweh is addressing some group of people. That group could be: (1\) the wicked Judeans who are still disobeying Yahweh despite his warnings. In that case, Yahweh would be using the term **wait** to indicate that he is certainly going to do what he describes. Your language may use the term “wait” in this same sense. If not, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “‘Therefore, you sinful Judeans, just wait!’—the declaration of Yahweh—‘One day soon I will arise to the prey’” or “‘Therefore you can be certain, you sinful Judeans’—the declaration of Yahweh—‘that one day soon I will arise to the prey’” (2\) the “humble of the earth” whom Zephaniah mentions in [2:3](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:3). In that case, Yahweh would be using the term **wait** to tell them to be patient until he punishes sin and enforces justice.

(This could be an allusion to the description of Jerusalem’s “princes” as “lions” and its “judges” as “wolves” in [3:3](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:3), indicating that those who preyed on others will themselves become prey.)

Alternate translation: “I will surely give the peoples righteous character so that they will say pure things; then they will pray to me acceptably” (2\) that by invoking the names of other gods (as described in [1:5](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:5)), they had made themselves unworthy to pray to Yahweh, but he will cleanse their capacity to speak so that they can pray to him.

**"But they will graze and lie down, and there will be none frightening {them"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the people in the remnant of Israel will be animals that will **graze** and **lie down** in pastures. He means that they will be able to live peacefully, like animals grazing undisturbed out in a field. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But they will be able to live without anyone disturbing them”

## Zephaniah 3:14 (#1) (id: 279550)

**"Sing,"** \- **"Shout,"** \- **"Rejoice and exult"**

The implied “you” in the imperatives **Sing**, **Rejoice**, and **exult** is singular because Zephaniah is addressing a group as if it were a single individual. The implied “you” in the imperative **Shout** is plural because Zephaniah is addressing a group as a number of individuals. Use the same singular and plural forms in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you” and you decide to retain the singular and plural forms of address. However, see the notes to the rest of this verse, which suggest the possibility of using a plural address throughout the verse.

**""your judgments;"**

As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words “you” and “your” are singular in these instances and generally in verses 16–19 because they are addressing Jerusalem as an individual. If you decide to retain the singular address, use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction, but use plural forms if you decide to have a plural address.

**"your judgments"**

Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe **judgments** that the people of Jerusalem have made but to describe judgments that **Yahweh** has made against them. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “his judgments against you”

**"The king of Israel"**

It is true in one sense that **Yahweh** is the **king** of the people of **Israel**. As their God, he is the ruler whom they must obey. But in another sense, he is not literally the king who rules from the palace in Jerusalem. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The ruler of Israel” or “The God whom the Israelites worship and obey”

**"it will be said"**

If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Some languages might use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “they will say”

## Zephaniah 3:16 (#3) (id: 279562)

**""to Jerusalem,"**

The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **Do not fear** are singular here because they are addressing **Zion** as an individual. However, the implied “you” in the imperative **Do not slacken** is plural because it envisions Zion as a group consisting of a number of individuals. You may have decided to use plural forms in verses 16–19\. Alternate translation, using plural forms: “to the people of Jerusalem, ‘Do not fear, you people of Zion! None of you slacken your hands’”

## Zephaniah 3:16 (#4) (id: 279563)

**""Do not fear, Zion!"**

These two phrases mean similar things. The people who are speaking to Zion are using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (They are referring to the way that a person’s hands **slacken** or become limp when that person is afraid.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “There is no reason for you to become weak with fear, Zion”

**"he will be silent in his love"**

Since the people who are speaking to Jerusalem say that Yahweh will **rejoice** and **exult**, they do not mean that he will literally **be silent.** Rather, they mean that Yahweh will no longer speak words of condemnation and judgment against Jerusalem. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in his love, he will no longer speak to condemn you”

**""I will gather the ones grieving for the solemn assembly, they are from you;"**

This verse is very difficult to understand. Modern versions translate it in many different ways. The ULT offers one reasonable interpretation of it. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it expresses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation of ULT.

## Zephaniah 3:18 (#2) (id: 279566)

**"I will gather the ones grieving for the solemn assembly, they are from you"**

Yahweh may be using one kind of worship, a **solemn assembly**, to mean worship in general. He is addressing the city of Jerusalem as if it were an individual, so the phrase **they are from you** may be clarifying that the people who are **grieving** are Judeans who have been taken into exile and who are sad because they can no longer participate in the worship of Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will bring back the Judeans who have been taken into exile, who are sad because they cannot take part in public worship of me”

**"the reproach {was} a burden upon her"**

Yahweh is speaking as if the **reproach** of being conquered were literally a **burden** or heavy weight that Jerusalem was carrying with difficulty. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it was painful for the people of Jerusalem to feel the disgrace of being conquered”

## Zephaniah 3:19 (#1) (id: 279569)

**"And I will save the lame and gather the cast\-out one"**

The expressions **lame** and **cast\-out one** are both feminine singular, suggesting that Yahweh is using both expressions to refer to Jerusalem as if that city were a female individual. In that case, Yahweh would be using repetition to emphasize the idea that these phrases express. The reference would actually be to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, who would be **lame** or limping from the difficulty of walking from their homeland to a place of exile and who could be described as **cast\-out** since they had been taken from their homeland. It may be helpful to indicate in your translation that these two phrases are expressing the same idea. Alternate translation: “And I will rescue the people of Judah who are limping from walking so far away from home; yes, I will bring them back from exile”

**"the lame"**

Yahweh is using the adjective **lame** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

**""And I will turn them into praise,"**

Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language.

**"I will bring you in"**

As the General Notes to this chapter indicate, the words **you** and **your** are plural in this verse. Yahweh is now addressing the people of Judah as a group of individuals. If you have been using singular and plural forms in your translation to show the different kinds of address in this chapter, you may wish to indicate explicitly that the address changes to plural here.

**"Yahweh has spoken"**

Zephaniah is using this phrase to indicate that verses 18–20 have been a quotation of a message that Yahweh gave him for the people of Judah. (This phrase means the same thing as “the declaration of Yahweh,” which occurs several times in the book.) Consider natural ways of identifying direct quotations in your language. It may be more natural for you to put this attribution of the saying to Yahweh at the beginning of the message, that is, at the start of verse 18, as the UST does.

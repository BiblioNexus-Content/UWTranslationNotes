## Malachi - Introduction (id: 775319)

Introduction to Malachi
=======================

Part 1: General Introduction
----------------------------

### Outline of Malachi

1:1 Title 1:2–5 Yahweh will punish the wicked: Edom 1:6–14 Judeans not bringing acceptable sacrifices 2:1–9 Priests must teach and apply the law faithfully 2:10–16 Yahweh is concerned for justice: no divorce 2:17–3:5 Yahweh is concerned for justice and will punish evildoers 3:6–12 Judeans not bringing proper tithes 3:13–15 Yahweh will punish the wicked, despite what Judeans are saying 3:16–4:6 Yahweh will bless and protect those who fear him

The overall structure of the book follows a pattern called “chiasm,” which Hebrew writers considered to be particularly elegant in poetry and literature. There are six main parts to this structure. The chiasm pattern is ABCCBA. In terms of theme, the first and sixth parts are found in (1:2–5 and 3:13–15\), the second and fifth parts match (1:6–14 and 3:6–12\), and the third and fourth parts match (2:10–16 and 2:17–3:5\). There is also an excursus, a special message to the priests (2:1–9\), and an epilogue telling how the people responded to the message of the book and what Yahweh promised them (3:16–4:6\).

### What is the book of Malachi about?

The book of Malachi contains prophecies that address the Jews who had returned to Judah from exile in Babylon. At that time, the Jews were discouraged even though they had finished building a new temple. The wonderful things that previous prophets had promised for Judah had not yet happened. The Persian Empire still ruled over them. As a result, they no longer were concerned about the law or worshiping Yahweh. These prophecies rebuke the Judeans for not living as the law taught and for not bringing proper tithes and sacrifices. But the prophecies also assure the Judeans that Yahweh will ultimately do everything that he promised to do.

### Who wrote the book of Malachi?

The description in the book title ([1:1](https://ref.ly/Mal1:1)) could either be translated “the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of Malachi” or “the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of my messenger.” The last expression in that sentence also occurs in [3:1](https://ref.ly/Mal3:1), where the context indicates that it should be translated as “my messenger.” However, the expression could well be the name of the man in the book title. That man would be the prophet who delivered these messages on behalf of Yahweh. However, we do not know anything else about this man—where he lived, what family he came from, etc. Translating the expression as a name is the most common interpretation, and that is the interpretation that the ULT and these notes follow. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the same interpretation as the ULT.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

This book traditionally has been titled “Malachi” or “The Book of Malachi.” Translators may decide to call it something like “The Sayings of Malachi” or “The Messages that Malachi Brought.”

Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts
---------------------------------------

### The “day of Yahweh”

The book of Malachi speaks about the “day of Yahweh” in 3:2–5 and 3:17–4:6\. It also calls it “the day that is coming” and “the day of his coming,” and Yahweh calls it “the day that I am preparing.” All of these are references to the time when Yahweh will come and judge people. He would remove those who have wickedly sinned and bless those who have trusted in him. (See: Day of the Lord)

Part 3: Translation Issues
--------------------------

### “But you say”

In each of the six thematic sections of the book, the prophet makes a statement that challenges the people and gets their attention. Its meaning is not immediately clear. The prophet then anticipates how the people will respond. He introduces their likely response with the phrase “But you say” (1:2, 1:6, 1:7, 1:13, 2:14, 2:17, 3:7, 3:8, 3:13\). After saying how he expects they would respond, he then explains what his provocative statement meant. This was a common practice of Jewish public speakers in this time period (and also in New Testament times). The phrase “But you say” occurs throughout the book as Malachi anticipates and answers objections. It would be helpful to translate the phrase consistently so that your readers can appreciate the method he is using to challenge the Judeans.

### Yahweh of Armies

This is an important title of God that is used more than 20 times throughout the book of Malachi. It reminds the listeners of the great power that Yahweh has to judge and punish all nations. Be sure to translate it consistently throughout the book so that your readers can appreciate the emphasis that Malachi places on it. (See: Yahweh of Hosts)

## Malachi 1:1 (#1) (id: 775321)

**"The burden of the word of Yahweh"**

The editor of the book is speaking as if the **word of Yahweh** were a **burden** that Malachi was carrying. This is likely a reference to the serious nature of what Yahweh told Malachi to say. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[The serious word from Yahweh]

## Malachi 1:1 (#2) (id: 775322)

* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: 33324)

## Malachi 1:1 (#4) (id: 775324)

**"by the hand of"**

The author is using one part of Malachi, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of bringing Yahweh’s message to the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: \[through]

In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: \[Yahweh says, ‘I have loved you’]

See: Quotations and Quote Margins

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Quotations and Quote Margins (ID: 33426)

## Malachi 1:2 (#2) (id: 775327)

**"you"**

The word **you** is plural here because Yahweh is addressing the Israelites as a group, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. The words “you,” “your,” and “yourselves” are usually plural in this book when they refer to the Israelites. These notes will indicate any exceptions. The word “you” is always singular when it refers to Yahweh.

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: 33321)

## Malachi 1:2 (#3) (id: 775328)

**"But you say"**

Malachi is probably not quoting an actual response from the Judeans. Rather, he is anticipating an objection, stating it, and then answering it. See the further discussion in the General Introduction to Malachi. Alternate translation: \[Now you may object]

See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

## Malachi 1:2 (#4) (id: 775329)

**"Was} not Esau a brother to Jacob?” the declaration of Yahweh. “Yet I loved Jacob"**

If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases so that the speaker, **Yahweh**, is identified before we read the words which he speaks. Alternate translation: \[Yahweh declares, “Was not Esau a brother to Jacob? Yet I loved Jacob”]

See: Information Structure

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Information Structure (ID: 33286)

## Malachi 1:2 (#5) (id: 775330)

**"Was} not Esau a brother to Jacob"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: \[Now Esau was Jacob’s brother]

See: Rhetorical Question

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Rhetorical Question (ID: 33310)

## Malachi 1:2 (#6) (id: 775331)

**"Was} not Esau a brother to Jacob"**

Yahweh is using the names **Esau** and **Jacob** by association to mean their descendants. Alternate translation: \[Are the Edomites not a related people group to you Israelites?] or \[Now the Edomites are a related people group to you Israelites]

See: Metonymy

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Metonymy (ID: 33293)

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Collective Nouns (ID: 33324)

## Malachi 1:2–3 (#1) (id: 775334)

**"Yet I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated"**

Here the author uses a poetic device called a chiasm, which Hebrew writers often used in poetry and literature. The outer phrases **I loved** and **I hated** parallel each other and the inner words, **Jacob** and **Esau** parallel each other. So the pattern is ABBA. If it is possible in your language you should try to retain this order.

See: Poetry

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:2
* **Associated Articles:** Poetry (ID: 33422)

## Malachi 1:3 (#1) (id: 775335)

**"but Esau I hated"**

The word translated as **hated** does not always indicate a strong antipathy or loathing. In a comparison such as this one, it can mean “loved less” or “favored less.” If it would help your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: \[but I have not favored Esau or his descendants, the Edomites]

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:3
* **Associated Articles:** Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information (ID: 33273)

* **Associated Articles:** Abstract Nouns (ID: 33257)

## Malachi 1:3 (#3) (id: 775337)

**"for the jackals of"**

A **jackal** is a wild dog that lives in the desert. If your readers would not be familiar with what a jackal is, in your translation you could use the name of a similar animal that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: \[desert scavengers]

## Malachi 1:4 (#1) (id: 775338)

**"Though Edom says"**

The word **Edom** is another name for “Esau.” Yahweh uses the word **Edom** by association to mean Esau’s descendants. If it would be helpful to your readers you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: \[Though the Edomites say]

## Malachi 1:4 (#4) (id: 775341)

**"And they will call them"**

Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun, as modeled by the UST.

## Malachi 1:5 (#1) (id: 775343)

**"And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say, ‘Great is Yahweh beyond the border of Israel"**

The words in this verse could: (1\) be a continuation of Yahweh’s words that began in the previous verse. If you treat this as a quotation from Yahweh, it may be more natural in your language not to have a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: \[And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say that Yahweh is great beyond the border of Israel] (2\) the words of Malachi. If you choose this option, you will need to add closing quotes at the end of the previous verse or whatever means your language uses to end a quotation, and use whatever punctuation your language requires to indicate that Malachi is speaking. Alternate translation: \[And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say, “Great is Yahweh beyond the border of Israel”]

**"And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say, ‘Great is Yahweh beyond the border of Israel"**

## Malachi 1:8 (#2) (id: 775353)

**"the blind"** \- **"the lame and the sick"**

Yahweh is not referring to specific blind, lame, or sick animals. He means animals with these conditions in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: \[blind animals … lame and sick animals]

## Malachi 1:8 (#4) (id: 775355)

**"to your governor. Will he accept you"** \- **"your face"**

The words **you** and **your** are singular here because Yahweh is addressing the priests as a collective group. This suits the context, since that is how they were ruled by their **governor**. It may be natural for you to use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

See: Forms of ‘You’ — Singular

* **Associated Passages:** MAL 1:8
* **Associated Articles:** Forms of ‘You’ — Singular (ID: 33321)

## Malachi 1:8 (#5) (id: 775356)

**"Will he accept you or lift up your face"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: \[He certainly will not accept you or lift up your face!]

**"Will he accept you or lift up your face"**

The terms **accept you** and **lift up your face** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: \[He certainly will not show you any favor at all!]

## Malachi 1:9 (#1) (id: 775359)

**"And now"**

The word the ULT translated as **And now** is an expression that was used in messages of this time to introduce important points. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation.

## Malachi 1:9 (#2) (id: 775360)

**"the face of God, that he may be gracious to us"**

Malachi attributes this quotation to Yahweh, but it is something that Yahweh told him to say to the priests. So you could translate it with Malachi as the speaker. However, if you translate it with Yahweh as the speaker, he would be speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be more natural in your language, you could translate it in the first person. Alternate translation: \[my face, that I may be gracious to you]

## Malachi 1:9 (#3) (id: 775361)

**"the face of God"**

Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **face**, to mean all of him in the act of looking with favor on someone who was praying to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[God]

* **Associated Articles:** Synecdoche (ID: 33315)

## Malachi 1:9 (#4) (id: 775362)

**"the face of God"**

Malachi is probably using the term **God** here to contrast with the mention of “the governor” in the previous verse. The implication is that if people would not offer inferior gifts to a human being, they should certainly not offer them to God. So here it would be appropriate to use your language’s term for the true God who created the world rather than using the name Yahweh.

## Malachi 1:9 (#5) (id: 775363)

**"that he may be gracious to us"**

Malachi is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (If you are treating this as a direct quotation from Yahweh, you may use the plural form of “you.”)

**"the Lord"**

In the same phrase in [1:7](https://ref.ly/Mal1:7), the name “Yahweh” is used. Here a title, **the Lord**, is used instead. It may be that in the earlier instance Yahweh is speaking of himself in the third person, while in this instance Yahweh is quoting what the priests would say. (In order not to misuse his name, Jews would use this title instead.) Some versions of the Bible use their representation of the divine name here, since that is what the priests meant. Other versions use the title **Lord** to reflect this Jewish practice and the original text of the book. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

Malachi 2 General Notes
=======================

Structure and Formatting
------------------------

2:1–9 Priests must teach and apply the law faithfully

2:10–16 Yahweh is concerned for justice: no divorce

2:17–3:5 Yahweh is concerned for justice and will punish evildoers

Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter
-----------------------------------------------

### “My covenant was with him, life and peace, and I gave them to him {for} fear” (2:5\)

Here Yahweh seems to be alluding implicitly to what he said in [Numbers 25:12–13](https://ref.ly/Num25:12-Num25:13), that he was making a **covenant** of **peace** establishing Phineas (the son of the first high priest, Aaron) and his descendants in the priesthood permanently. Yahweh did this because Phineas zealously opposed the worship of foreign gods. That is what Yahweh means here by “I gave them to him for fear.” He is saying, in other words, “because he worshiped me exclusively and devotedly.” Yahweh was punishing the Israelites for this idol\-worship with a plague that was killing many of them, but he ended the plague because of what Phineas did. So this was a covenant of **peace** (Yahweh was no longer hostile to the Israelites). It was also a covenant of **life** (Yahweh was no longer punishing the Israelites with death). The word **life** may also reflect that this was a permanent covenant that would not end. The notes to [2:5](https://ref.ly/Mal2:5) suggest ways to translate these statements.

Translation Issues
------------------

### And did he not make one (2:15a)

Here are two views Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1\) The word **one** refers to the close connection a husband and wife have. Alternate translation: \[And did not God make you one with your wife?] (2\) The word **one** refers to God. Alternate translation: \[And did not the one God make you]

### and a remnant of spirit {was} to him? (2:15b)

Here are two views, among many, that Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1\) These words mean that a husband and wife are united in body and spirit. Alternate translation: \[God made you to become united with your wife in body and spirit] (2\) These words mean that the bodies and spirits of a husband and wife belong to God. Alternate translation: \[and you and your wife belong to God]

### “and one {who} covers over his garment with violence” (2:16\)

Here are three views Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1\) it means that husband and wife Malachi is speaking as if **violence** were a substance with which a person could cover a **garment**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The idea of complete covering conveys emphasis. Alternate translation: \[and one who acts very violently] (2\) The word **violence** refers to harsh actions that could include actions other than divorce. Alternate translation: \[and one who acts violently] (3\) The word **violence** refers to violent or cruel actions which a person conceals. Alternate translation: \[and one who conceals their violence]

## Malachi 2:14 (#1) (id: 775463)

**"Yahweh is a witness between you and between the wife of your youth"**

In this culture, when people made promises to one another, they often did this with witnesses watching. The role of those witnesses included holding the people to their promises. The Judean men had made covenant promises to their wives when they married them. Malachi assumes that those men will know that when he refers to Yahweh as a **witness**, he means that Yahweh is holding them to those promises. Yahweh is doing that by showing his disfavor through not accepting their offerings. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: \[Because Yahweh is enforcing the covenant promises you made to the wife of your youth]

**"between you"** \- **"your youth"** \- **"you yourself have dealt treacherously"** \- **"was} your companion"** \- **"your covenant"**

Except for the first occurrence of the the word **you**, the words **you**, **your**, and **yourself** are singular in this verse because, even though Malachi is speaking to the Judeans as a group, he is addressing an individual situation. So use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

## Malachi 3:2 (#2) (id: 775484)

**"But who {will be} enduring the day of his coming? And who {will be} the one standing in his appearing"**

Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: \[No one will be able to endure the day of his coming! No one will be able to stand when he appears!]

## Malachi 3:2 (#3) (id: 775485)

**"But who {will be} enduring the day of his coming? And who {will be} the one standing in his appearing"**

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than “and” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: \[No one will be able to endure the day of his coming! Indeed, no one will be able to stand when he appears!]

## Malachi 3:2 (#4) (id: 775486)

**"will be} the one standing"**

Yahweh is using the image of **standing** to speak of a person being declared innocent. The idea is that if he were declared guilty, that would be like a weight too heavy for the person to carry, and the person would sink down under it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: \[will be declared innocent]

**"he {will be} like the fire of a refiner and like the soap of launderers"**

The point of this comparison is that just as fire refines metal and soap cleans clothes, so the messenger will purify the people, that is, he will help them forsake the sins they have been committing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: \[just as fire refines metal and soap cleans clothes, he will purify people by helping them stop sinning]

Yahweh is speaking as if the messenger were going to be a metalworker who was **refining** and **purifying** precious metals. Since he expresses this same image as a comparison in the next clause, you may wish to present it as a comparison here as well. Alternate translation: \[Yes, in that way he will be like someone who sits refining and purifying silver]

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.
